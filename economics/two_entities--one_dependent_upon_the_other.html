Two entities — one dependent upon the other
</h1>

<div class="line">

<h2>
Model
</h2>

<ol>
<li>Two entities: F and T.</li>
<li>F ('farmer') produces a product P_F.</li>
<li>T ('technician') produces a product P_T in single quantities.</li>
<li>P_F is necessary for T's survival in quantity S.</li>
<li>P_T is not necessary for F's survival.</li>
<li>P_F can be delivered to T in quantity Q at intervals of duration D_F.</li>
<li>P_T can be delivered to F at intervals of duration D_T.</li>
</ol>

<div class="line">
</div>

<h2>
Stability
</h2>

<p>
Stability (permanent survival of T) can occur only under the following conditions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Repeated delivery of P_T is desirable for F.</li>
<li>Q is greater than or equal to S.</li>
<li>D_T is less than or equal to D_F.</li>
</ol>

<div class="line">
</div>

<h2>
Verdict
</h2>

Survival of T is extremely fragile, dependent upon the whim of F: the desirability of P_T for F cycle after cycle, as well as F's willingness and ability to produce P_F for T in sufficiently high quantities.

<div class="line">
</div>

<h2>
Variants
</h2>

<ol>
<li>If, instead of one 'farmer' F, there are n 'farmers', condition 1. for stability can be relaxed from desirability of repeated delivery for every cycle of the model to desirability of repeated delivery every n cycles. T's survival over a greater number of model cycles is more likely, but T's ultimate survival remains fragile.</li>
<li>Condition 1. for survival can be circumnavigated if T is able to produce a new product in single quantities for each cycle ('innovation'), each of which is desirable for F. The fragility of T's survival is not significantly lessened.</li>
<li>If D_T is significantly less than D_F, greater flexibility is possible with regard to the respective deliveries of P_F and P_T (e.g. one delivery of P_F might be made in the same cycle as two deliveries of P_T, whilst in the next cycle a delivery of P_F might be made with no delivery of P_T), but the model is not significantly altered. </li>
</ol>

<div class="line">
</div>

<h2>
Effect of regulation
</h2>

<ol>
<li>F could be required through regulation to produce P_F in quantity S at intervals of duration D_F. This would remove the whim of F from consideration for the survival of T. The ability of F to produce P_F in sufficient quantities in time is unlikely to be able to regulated, however. </li>
</ol>
