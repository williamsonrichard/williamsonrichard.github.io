Now that the last lecture has been given, I would just like to thank all of you for your participation. It has truly been a pleasure teaching you, I have enjoyed it greatly. I'm sure that you will all do very well on the exam &mdash; I very much hope that you will do so, and wish you the best of luck!

Mock exam
</h2>

<p>
<a href="mock_exam.pdf">pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
The mock exam is in the same style as the real exam will be. The questions are overall perhaps slightly more difficult than those which will be asked on the real exam.
</p>

<p>
About half a question more on the real exam compared to the mock exam will be taken from the knot theory and surfaces part of the course.

</p>

<p>
A third revision class on knot theory and surfaces took place on Wednesday, 22/05.  
</p>

<p>
It is very important that you understand all of the solutions from the classes, except any which are marked as non-examinable. Just let me know if not, and I will be happy to help.

All the lectures on knot theory have now been uploaded, as well as all the examinable lectures from the first part of the course.

<p>
I plan to combine the remaining lectures on surfaces into one. I have uploaded a few excerpts. </p>


<p>
If you know Latex, you are welcome to edit the source files for the lectures. For example, it is possible to make annotations. Here are the files for Lectures 1 &ndash; 14. <a href="generell_topologi.tar.gz">tar</a>

<p>
This is a tarball, which needs to be extracted. The file which needs to be compiled (with pdflatex) is 'generell_topologi.tex'.

<a name="introduction"></a> 

<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
Topology is the study of topological spaces, which are of indispensable importance across mathematics, and are equally important in physics, computer science, and other disciplines. </p>

<p>
If the idea of studying gadgets such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(mathematics)">knots</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip">M&ouml;bius band</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle">Klein bottle</a>, or of turning a sphere <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_a_sphere_inside_out">inside out</a>, intrigues you, or if you are baffled as to how a hundred year old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">problem</a> proven recently can be of a completely different flavour in three and four dimensions than in five or more, this course is where you should start! 
</p>

<p>
If you have enjoyed courses in analysis, geometry, or algebra, or any combination of these, it's likely that you'll find something to your taste in topology &mdash; it's a rich and diverse subject, and further study can lead in any or all of these directions.
</p>

<p>
This course will have two goals:

<ol>
<li> To introduce examples of topological spaces, illustrating various phenomena, and conveying something of topology's geometric flavour.</li>
<li> To develop the foundations of topology relied upon in higher courses.
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Upon successful completion of the course, you will have acquired knowledge which will open up doors to higher courses, and will have developed skills &mdash; the suppleness of mind needed to understand topological pheneomena intuitively; an ability to reason at a more abstract level than you have probably come across before; the organisation and discipline necessary to match topological intuition to abstract rigour &mdash; which will be valuable to you in your chosen career.

Formal details
</h2>

<p>
The lectures will be given in English.
</p>

<p>
The official course description may be found <a href="http://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/MA3002/2012#tab=omEmnet">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
There are no formal pre-requisite courses, but most of the mathematics courses you have taken previously would likely be helpful in one way or another.

<h2>
Course materials and textbook
</h2>

Supporting materials for the course &mdash; e.g. lecture notes and exercise sheets &mdash; will be posted here.

<p>
There is no obligatory textbook &mdash; the examination will be based upon the contents of the lectures and the exercise sheets.
</p>

<p>
However, the following textbook is recommended if you are looking for a book to support the lectures. The bookstore will order 10 copies.
</p>

<p>
M.A.Armstrong, <em> Basic Topology. </em>

There are many other textbooks which you may find helpful. A brief <a href="#literatureguide">guide</a> can be found above.
