<h1 id="how-can-i-model-sequences">How can I model sequences?</h1>
<h2 id="records-in-order">Records in order</h2>
<p>It frequently happens that records assemble into a sequence, whose
order it is important to preserve. Database migrations, for example, be
stored in a directory in a digital file system, its contents being
sorted lexicographically by file name; one would typically prefix these
by a date or by increasing numbers to ensure that the order is
retained.</p>
<pre><code>001--first-migration.pdf 002--second-migration.file.pdf 003--third-migration.pdf</code></pre>
<p>In a structured archival description, we would prefer not to mix
semantics in this way: a name should simply be a name! We would like to
have specific metadata for expressing that we have a sequence.</p>
<p>Consider correspondence between a citizen and an official body: an
initial inquiry sent by the citizen, a reply by the official body, a
response to this reply by the citizen, and so on. The order of the
copies of these records kept by the official body may well be able to be
gleaned from inspection of their contents, or even just from their form:
the iterative usage in the subject line of ‘Re:’, ‘Re: Re:’, ‘Re: Re:
Re:’ and so on would have been enough in the early days of email, for
instance! Again, though, we would prefer to record the order in metadata
intended for the purpose.</p>
<p>A sequence number might be assigned to each of the records. This,
though, is still quite weak and fragile, as we shall discuss <a
href="#beyond-sequence-numbers">below</a>. RiC takes the point of view
that a sequence is better expressed by relations <em>between</em>
records: that one record <em>follows or followed</em> (RiC-R008i), or
inversely <em>precedes or preceded</em> (RiC-R008), another, as
follows.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/correspondence_sequence.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/correspondence_sequence.svg"
alt="Correspondence sequence" /></a></p>
<p>As an aside, RiC can express many more aspects of this
correspondence, a few of which are illustrated below. These would allow
for searching for a reply to given inquiry, or to all replies to a
particular person, and so on. Dates, and more, could also be included.
But this is not our focus here.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-sequence-numbers">Beyond sequence numbers</h2>
<p>Let us turn to a different example, of a hospital ward. At the end of
their shift, a nurse writes a report on each of their patients. The
end-of-shift reports for a particular patient during their stay form a
sequence of records which we could model in RiC as follows (including
some context).</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="End-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>Suppose that the hospital’s record managers alas are not yet aware of
RiC. Instead, they assign a sequence number to each of the shift
reports.</p>
<p>In the course of their shift, the nurse may also write progress notes
for this patient. Together, the progress notes and end-of-shift notes
also form a sequence. But if the hospital’s record managers wish to
refer both to this sequence and the one consisting only of end-of-shift
reports, their metadata for a record cannot merely have a single
sequence number; some workaround is needed. They might have two
different fields, ‘end-of-shift report number’ and ‘nurse report
number’, say. Or they might expand upon the syntax for sequence indexing
so that it is not simply a number, say S1-1, S1-2, S1-3, … and S2-1,
S2-2, S2-3, … for progress notes written during the first and second
shifts respectively, and S1-R and S2-R for the first and second
end-of-shift reports respectively. But in both approaches, and indeed
any other, the complexity and fragility of the metadata and record
management increases.</p>
<p>The hospital record managers might need to go even further. Progress
notes for the patient written by doctors, for instance, might also need
to be considered as a separate sequence, or as part of a sequence
including the nurses’ progress notes and shift reports. Chaos!</p>
<p>By contrast, when expressing sequences in a local way as RiC does —
relations between pairs of records — no expansion of the metadata schema
is necessary: one can simply add in extra <em>precedes or preceded</em>
(or its inverse <em>follows or followed</em>; we will omit to mention
this possibility from now on, but it is always there) relations. The
following illustrates this for a sequence of nurses’ progress notes and
end-of-shift reports (omitting context this time): note, for instance, a
<em>precedes or preceded</em> relation not only between the second
end-of-shift report and the third, and but also between the second
end-of-shift report and the second and third progress notes. If one is
only interested in the progress notes, one simply ignores the
end-of-shift report nodes and the arrows to and from them, and similarly
in other cases.</p>
<p><a
href="../diagrams/progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="Progress notes and end-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>RiC’s approach also allows for flexibility in assembly of sequential
metadata. It might be that the nurses use an app to log their progress
notes and end-of-shift reports, but that the app itself does not regard
end-of-shift reports as part of a sequence, because they are primarily
referred to by the incoming nurse after a change of shift. In other
words, within the app, one has something conceptually equivalent to the
following, where the end-of-shift reports are isolated nodes.</p>
<p><a
href="../diagrams/progress_notes_and_isolated_end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/progress_notes_and_isolated_end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="Progress notes and isolated end-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>It might be only later, perhaps upon discharge of the patient and
subsequent archiving of the documentation of the patient’s stay in the
record managers’ software, that the extra <em>precedes or preceded</em>
relations are added. (This diagram is a different arrangement of part of
the one involving both progress shifts and end-of-shift reports
above.)</p>

href="../diagrams/joined_progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/joined_progress_notes_and_end-of-shift_reports.svg"
alt="Joined progress notes and end-of-shift reports" /></a></p>
<p>Whereas, even if one’s sequence is only a simple chain, if one relies
upon sequence numbers, any change in it will necessitate recomputing the
sequence numbers for all of those records after the point at which the
change was made.</p>
<h2 id="not-only-chains">Not only chains</h2>
<p>Sequences of records can assemble into other shapes, which too can be
expressed in RiC. Suppose, for example, that in between a nurse writing
a progress note and a later second one, two different doctors — with
different fields of expertises, say — visit the patient, and write
progress notes too. In different contexts, any or all of the paths
through the diamond might be relevant.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/diamond_of_progress_notes.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/diamond_of_progress_notes.svg"
alt="Diamond of progress notes" /></a></p>
<p>For a different example, suppose that it was a heart attack that the
patient suffered. Following discharge, they might visit a hospital
regularly for physiotherapy and clinical follow-up. Our record managers
might represent these two sequences of visits as a bifurcation of the
chain of documentation created during the patient’s hospital stay into
independent offshoots.</p>

alt="Bifurcation following discharge" /></a></p>
<h2 id="different-points-of-view">Different points of view</h2>
<p>We have so far discussed records pertaining to a single patient. But
other points of view might be important for our record managers, for
example per-nurse. One of the principal aspects of RiC is its
flexibility in describing how records are assembled; <a
href="https://rwilliamson-mathematics.info/records_in_contexts/difficult_concepts.html">elsewhere</a>
we have discussed the non-rigid boundary between record set, record, and
record part in RiC, but RiC also allows for records to be included in
other records (and the same for record sets and record parts), and we
could make use of this here as follows. The relevant sequence for Nurse
1 is in the middle of the diagram, whilst sequences for Patient A and
Patient B are above and below it respectively.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/nurse_point_of_view.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/nurse_point_of_view.svg"
alt="Nurse point of view" /></a></p>
<h2 id="ric-o">RiC-O</h2>
<p>RiC-O has a little extra granularity in its formalisation of
<em>precedes or preceded</em>: one has both
<em>rico:directlyPrecedesInSequence</em> and
<em>rico:precedesInSequenceTransitive</em> in addition to
<em>rico:precedesOrPreceded</em> (and an inverse for each of these), in
decreasing order of precision (each is a sub-property of the next). In
an archival context, use of <em>rico:directlyPrecedesInSequence</em>
would be very typical for serquences, as by the time of their arrival at
an archival institution, it may be that the records under consideration
are regarded as somewhat ‘set in stone’, and one can then likely assert
that a record directly precedes another with a high probability that one
would not need to revise this. Whereas in a records management context,
or in a more dynamic archival setting, use of
<em>rico:precedesInSequenceTransitive</em> by default might be
appropriate for sequences, as this allows for insertions in the middle
of a sequence without needing to alter any existing relations. In RiC-O,
<code>rico:precedesOrPreceded</code> would typically best be used
directly (it can inferred indirectly in all cases) in a non-sequential
context, or more precisely a context which one wishes to emphasise is
non-sequential (any record preceding another can be regarded as forming
a (rather short) sequence!).</p>
<p>Though the relational point of view on sequences that we have
discussed here is the one RiC is designed for and recommends, from RiC-O
1.1 a datatype property <em>rico:rankInSequence</em> is available which
does allow for indexing by a sequence number in addition. In simple
cases, it is as one would expect.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/rank_in_sequence.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/rank_in_sequence.svg" alt="Rank in sequence" /></a></p>
<p>RiC-O 1.1 also allows for use of <em>rico:rankInSequence</em> in
cases where a record appears in more than one sequence without
contradicting the semantics established by (one of the flavours of)
<em>precedes or preceded</em> — but the details of this would take us
too far afield here!</p>
