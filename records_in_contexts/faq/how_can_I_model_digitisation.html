<h1 id="how-can-i-model-digitisation">How can I model digitisation?</h1>
<h2
id="does-one-digitise-a-record-resource-or-an-instantiation-of-it">Does
one digitise a record resource or an instantiation of it?</h2>
<p>We suggest that one typically digitises an Instantiation (RiC-E06).
To see why, consider the purposes of digitisation. It may make a Record
Resource (RiC-E02) more widely available: online, or via another
electronic channel. Or it may contribute to more robust preservation of
the Record Resource: storing it in another medium. In both cases, the
intellectual aspect of the Record Resource — the information it holds —
is essentially unaltered; only the means of inscription of that
information, that is to say its instantiation, has changed.</p>
<p>That said, a digitisation might subsequently be enriched
intellectually. Suppose for example one were to take a Record (RiC-E04)
which is a certain text, and digitise it to a format which includes the
possibility of making comments. Suppose that one indeed does then add
comments in various places. The resulting file could certainly be
regarded as an instantiation of a new Record. Nevertheless, we suggest
not to view this kind of enrichment as part of digitisation itself.</p>
<h2 id="digitisation-as-an-activity">Digitisation as an activity</h2>
<p>Digitisation can be understood very broadly, encompassing all kinds
of media (visual, audio, and so on) and mechanisms: not only scanning of
a text, say, but human transcription (working from a non-electronic
source) of it could be seen to fall under it. At this level,
digitisation can be modelled as an Activity (RiC-E15).</p>
<p>A specific form of digitisation such as scanning too can be modelled
as an Activity. It can be related to the Activity of digitisation as a
whole by <em>is or was subevent of</em> (RiC-R006i) or its inverse
<em>has or had subevent</em> (RiC-R006).</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/digitisation--as_activity.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/digitisation--as_activity.svg"
alt="Digitisation as activity" /></a></p>
<h2 id="digitisation-as-an-event">Digitisation as an event</h2>
<p>The digitisation of a particular Instantiation (RiC-E06) can be
modelled by an Event (RiC-E14). This Event can be related to the
Activity of digitisation described above — or, better, one of its more
specific forms, such as the Activity of scanning — by <em>is or was
subevent of</em> (RiC-R006i) or its inverse (RiC-R006).</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>is or was affected by</em> (RiC-R059i) or its
inverse <em>affects or affected</em> (RiC-R059) can be used to relate
the original Instantiation to the digitisation Event, whilst <em>results
or resulted in</em> (RiC-R061) or its inverse <em>results or resulted
from</em> (RiC-R061i) can be used to relate the digitisation Event to
the digitised Instantiation one ends up with.</p>
<p>In addition, we suggest use of <em>has or had derived
instantiation</em> (RiC-R014) to relate the original Instantiation to
the digitised one. Putting everything together, we end up with an
example as follows, for which we provide a <a
href="../ric-o_examples/digitisation--basic.owl">RiC-O
formulation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/digitisation--basic.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/digitisation--basic.svg"
alt="Basic digitisation modelling" /></a></p>
<p>In the example, we make use of
<em>rico:hasOrHadAnalogueInstantiation</em> and
<em>rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation</em>, which are currently
available only in RiC-O, not in RiC-CM. In RiC-CM, one can simply use
<em>has or had instantiation</em> (RiC-R025) in both cases.</p>
<h2 id="richer-modelling">Richer modelling</h2>
<p>A number of other attributes and relations can be made use of to
enrich a basic modelling of digitisation as above. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>is or was performed by</em> (RiC-R060) or its inverse
<em>performs or performed</em> (RiC-R060i), for expressing who carried
out the digitisation, or for which software or hardware was used,
recalling the possibility of a Mechanism (RiC-E13) as Agent;</li>
<li><em>occurred at date</em> (RiC-R084) or its inverse <em>is date of
occurrence of</em> (RiC-R084i), for expressing when the digitisation
took place;</li>
<li><em>is or was regulated by</em> (RiC-R063i) or its inverse
<em>regulates or regulated</em> (RiC-R063), for referring to an
institutional policy, perhaps derived from funding, under whose umbrella
the digitisation falls, or to laws or policies which govern the use of
the digitised instantiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The example below, for which we provide a <a
href="../ric-o_examples/digitisation--enriched.owl">RiC-O
formulation</a>, illustrates this. Other uses of <em>is or was regulated
by</em> (RiC-R063i) might have the digitisation Event as their domain
rather than the digitised Instantiation.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/digitisation--enriched.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/digitisation--enriched.svg"
alt="Enriched digitisation modelling" /></a></p>
<p>If the digitised instantiation in this example were in such a format
as to allow for comments, and if it were to be annotated through such
comments so as to be able to be judged, as per the discussion above, an
instantiation of a new record, one can as always use <em>has or had
instantiation</em> (RiC-R025) or its inverse <em>is or was instantiation
of</em> (RiC-R025i) to relate the new record to its instantiation. In
addition, <em>has genetic link to record resource</em> (RiC-R023) can be
used to relate the original record to the new one. The following example
illustrates this. We provide a <a
href="../ric-o_examples/digitisation--basic--new_record.owl">RiC-O
formulation</a>.</p>

alt="Digitisation resulting in new record modelling" /></a></p>
<h2 id="digitisation-of-a-record-part-or-record-set">Digitisation of a
Record Part or Record Set</h2>
<p>Though we have focused above upon an Instantiation of a Record
(RiC-E04), everything could equally have been said for an instantiation
of a Record Part (RiC-E05). It alse makes sense to speak of digitisation
of an instantiation of a Record Set (RiC-E03). The nuances of the
semantics are slightly different, but the modelling we have described
above still goes through, noting the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entity Date (RiC-E18) encompasses both single dates and periods
of time, the two being distinguished by Date Type (RiC-A42). A period of
time is likely to be appropriate when modelling digitisation of a Record
Set.</li>
<li>The relation <em>is or was performed by</em> (RiC-R060) is
many-to-many, and thus, if the digitisation of a Record Set was carried
out by several agents, there is no barrier to including all of them
through several applications of this relation. The same goes for many
other relations.</li>
<li>As ever, one can relate the digitisation of an Instantiation of a
Record Set to a digitisation of an Instantiation of a Record within this
Record Set by means of the <em>has or had component</em> (RiC-R004)
relation or its inverse <em>is or was component of</em>
(RiC-R004i).</li>
</ul>
<p>The example below illustrates some aspects of this. We provide a <a
href="../ric-o_examples/digitisation--record_set.owl">RiC-O
formulation</a>.</p>
