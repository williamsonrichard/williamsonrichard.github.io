<h2 data-number="6.18" id="a-difficult-matter"><span

<p>We shall focus here upon the Sámi people in a Norwegian context. At
the <a href="#other-minority-groups">end of this FAQ</a>, though, it
will be suggested that the fundamentals of the discussion generalise to
other minority groups.</p>
<p>The challenges facing the Sámi people are numerous, deep, and
difficult. Epistemological assumptions implicit in any Western — for
want of a better term — endeavour such as RiC are challenged by
indigenous conceptions of a Record, and only a semantics immersed in
Sámi culture could hope to truly do justice to Sámi records.
Nevertheless, interactions between the Sámi people and Western
institutions, largely upon the premises of the latter, are as
significant for the Sámi people today as ever, and have frequent
recourse to archival materials. It is here that RiC may have something
to offer.</p>
<p>That traditional archive practices are problematic when it comes to
indigenous peoples is well-established. For well over a century, records
have primarily been organised within hierarchies, usually with public
institutions at their top. Indigenous communities being completely of
outside these hierarchies and institutions, they are more or less
invisible within such a system. In addition, the lack of sensitivity to
indigenous perspectives — both within the archival and records
management domain and in society generally — has led to the omission or
obscuration of indigenous peoples both in records themselves and in
description of them.</p>
<p>RiC breaks down some of these barriers from a theoretical
perspective. It is fundamentally de-centralised rather than
hierarchical, and also is intensional rather than extensional: in RiC a
Record is not pre-conceived, with fields to be filled in to describe it,
rather it is defined by its relation to other entities, i.e. in a
context which is dynamic and allows for nuance and different
perspectives — relations can always be added, elaborated upon, or
qualified. We shall now discuss a few concrete examples of this; we hope
that the discussion will inspire more!</p>
<h2 data-number="6.19" id="challenging-over-reliance-on-sources"><span
class="header-section-number">6.19</span> Challenging over-reliance on
sources</h2>
<p>In legal cases pertaining to indigenous rights, references to the
Sámi in archival material are important. One source of these are
censuses of the population of Norway: the designations <em>lapp</em> or
<em>finn</em> (with spelling variants) indicated that a person was a
Sámi. But this has been turned upon its head: if few or no such
appellations are to be found in a census for a given area, it has
frequently been concluded, both in legal matters and by historians, that
there is little or no evidence of Sámi having been historically present
in the area.</p>
<p>However, focusing upon the census of 1801 in Norway, an <a
href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-05029-0_4">article</a>
argues on several grounds that this kind of volte-face is not
justifiable. There are contradictions between the census and parish
registers, methodological issues, and implausible dates. as the article
draws attention to, this is despite the National Archives of Norway
giving the following <a
href="https://www.arkivverket.no/en/find-your-ancestors/public-censuses#!%23block-body-2">guidance</a>
at the time of writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 1801 census has rightfully gained its reputation as solid and
reliable. It was carried out on Sunday, February 1, 1801, and is based
on complete lists of individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modelling below suggests one way that the objections of the
article can be brought into a description of the 1801 census, providing
context. Archival processes — whether facilitated by software or manual
— built upon RiC would allow the Rule in the model to be discovered upon
consideration of the 1801 census, or of any of the other entities
present.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/tackling_over-reliance_on_sources.svg"><img
src="diagrams/tackling_over-reliance_on_sources.svg"
alt="Tackling over-reliance on sources" /></a></p>
<p>Points of note include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The use of Activity and Rule to refer to archival activities in the
way we do in the model is a principal theme in these guidelines. See <a
href="06--faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place-can-you-elaborate-on-the-difference-between-activity-and-event">§6.3.2</a>.</li>
<li>The decentralised nature of RiC is such that the entity for the Sámi
people, modelled as a Group is as valid a point of entrance into this
description — all arrows in RiC have an inverse which goes in the
reverse direction! — as any other in the diagram. In archival standards
prior to RiC, such an entity would almost certainly not exist: the Sámi
people as a whole are almost certainly not e.g. the creator of any
fonds.</li>
<li>We make use of the fact that in RiC a Record Set need not have an
Instantiation, so that we are free to form intellectual aggregations for
the convenience of a description. Indeed, the 1801 census of Norway does
not exist in any physical form, being comprised of one volume per
parish, these being held by different regional archives in Norway. Nor
does the aggregation defined by ‘parish registers around 1801’: even if
held at the same location, these belong to different series, and
sometimes different fonds, in today’s hierarchies. We shall return to
this in greater depth <a
href="weaving-together-fragments">below</a>.</li>
<li>Though we have modelled Hermandstrand’s journal article only as a
Thing, it would be very possible to use a bibliographic standard to give
more details. See <a
href="07--extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#beyond-the-traditional-archival-context">§7.10</a>
for an example of this.</li>
<li>As in <a
href="06--faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#is-describing-the-content-of-a-record-within-rics-domain">§6.3.1</a>
and in general with meta-metadata (see <a
href="06--faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6.3.3</a>),
it would be possible to replace the use of the <em>Scope and
content</em> attribute with free-text content in the model with a Record
and an Event.</li>
</ol>
<p>In RiC, the analysis of the article can also be modelled to a greater
degree of granularity. See the following diagram for an example.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/details_over-reliance_on_sources.svg"><img
src="diagrams/details_over-reliance_on_sources.svg"
alt="Details over-reliance on sources" /></a></p>
<p>The entry for Magnild Andersdatter in the Alstahaug parish register
modelled here is the first in the fifth row from the top on right-hand
side of page 4 of <a
href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/2577/7">this digitisation</a>
of it. The more structured form of parish register discussed in <a
href="06--faq--record_or_record_set.html#parish-registers">§6.5</a> had
not yet arrived — it did so about ten years later.</p>
<p>As always, still further details could be added to enrich the
modelling. For instance, a <a
href="https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/census/search/1801?fornavn=Magnild&amp;etternavn=Andersdatter&amp;familiestilling=&amp;sivilstand=&amp;yrke=&amp;fodselsaar=&amp;alder=&amp;ny_husholdning=&amp;merknader=&amp;bosted=&amp;bydel=&amp;gaardsnummer=">search</a>
for the name Magnild Andersdatter amongst transcriptions of the 1801
census does point to a woman of the same marital status and occupation
registered in the census volume for Vefsn, near the bottom of the
left-hand side of page 70b-71a of <a
href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/58469/8">this
digitisation</a> of it. But even if this were to be the same person —
which if not impossible, must be doubtful — it would only strengthen the
arguments in the article as a whole, no indication being given that the
woman in Vefsn is a Sámi, by contrast with the grouping of designated
Sámi at the end of the census for this parish.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.20"
id="incorporating-map-data-into-a-sámi-context"><span
class="header-section-number">6.20</span> Incorporating map data into a
Sámi context</h2>
<p>The Sámi people are and were diverse in their ways of life — <a
href="#weaving-together-fragments">below</a> we shall focus upon traces
of coastal Sámi communities much further south in Norway than exist
today. But reindeer herding is an important part of the Sámi identity,
and a typical ingredient in high-profile conflicts.</p>
<p>There exist comprehensive scientific resources documenting the
immense impact of industry, transport infrastructure, and other kinds of
activity upon reindeer, for example the <a
href="https://reindeermaps.nina.no/">maps</a> of the Norwegian Institute
for Nature Research (NINA). The research data underlying these maps fits
into record management/archival orthodoxy, and it is more or less
certain that somebody exploring NINA’s work on reindeer will find the
data. Much less obvious is that the data will be discovered by someone
whose point of departure is Sámi rights; they would first have to
realise that NINA might be a place to look.</p>
<p>Stepping outside of a hierarchy with NINA at the top, and outside the
domain of statistics/research, as RiC can, would help. How this might
look is suggested in the following model. As in the previous section, a
key aspect of the following is the way in which a thread is formally
sewn between the Record Set and the Sámi people.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/reindeer_populations.svg"><img
src="diagrams/reindeer_populations.svg"
alt="Reindeer populations" /></a></p>
<p>A couple of technical notes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This example may be a good one to reflect upon with regard to the
distinction between Activity and Event, touched upon in <a
href="06--faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#are-activity-and-event-central-entities-in-ric-how-about-rule-and-place-can-you-elaborate-on-the-difference-between-activity-and-event">§6.3.2</a>.
In particular, following the criteria there, ‘Impact of human activities
upon reindeer populations’ is judged an Event rather than an Activity
because it lacks the ‘agent-designed and performed’ and ‘intended
purpose’ aspects of an Activity.</p></li>
<li><p>We have deliberately not made use of the relation <em>has or had
derived instantiation</em> between the ‘Data files on reindeer
populations’ Instantiation and the Thing representing the website of
reindeer maps. Indeed, such a relation would likely be judged to imply —
even if this is not quite explicitly stated in RiC-CM or enforced in
RiC-O at the present time — that the website is also an Instantiation of
the Record Set in the model. This does not seem quite correct: the
website is more of a tool to visualise some of the data in that Record
Set, which we may contrast with the digital photo album example given in
<a
href="06--faq--the_instantiation_entity.html#instantiations-of-record-sets">§6.10</a>
— there the essential aspects of the original photo collection seem
likely to have been preserved.</p>
<p>Instead, as we also do in <a
href="06--faq--record_or_record_set.html#a-little-more-mereology-record-part">§6.4.2</a>,
<a
href="07--extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#cultural-heritage-aspects">§7.9</a>,
and <a
href="07--extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#beyond-the-traditional-archival-context">§7.10</a>,
we have stepped outside of RiC and made use of a couple of properties
from another standard, the Dublin Core vocabulary in this case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Whilst it is possible to drill down, the data on reindeer in the
above models is first and foremost at a macro-level. An <a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214790X22000090">article</a>
on the impact of mines in Sweden in 2022 provides more localised
insights.</p>
<p>As another <a href="ODBlZWUzN2Q2NTQwNWNk">article</a> from 2018
conveys well, the Sámi conception of a route across land is
fundamentally different from the Western one. Data like that gathered
for the 2022 article is invaluable in lieu of a direct way, in a Western
setting, for the Sámi to point to a record of their use of the land.</p>
<p>Indeed, though it is only implicit in the study, in RiC we may deem
this data to <em>actually</em> be a Record of a traditional reindeer
herding route. We suggest a model below.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/documenting_reindeer_routes.svg"><img
src="diagrams/documenting_reindeer_routes.svg"
alt="Documenting reindeer routes" /></a></p>
<p>Some notes on this model:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Being freed from a necessity to classify records into where they fit
into a hierarchical scheme of things, we <a
href="#challenging-over-reliance-on-sources">again</a> need not, at this
point in time, make any judgement as to what Record Sets the Record
might belong to.</li>
<li>It is not asserted in the model that the research article itself is
a Record. Indeed, on the one hand we regard the writing of this article
as part of the provenance of the Record, as expressed in the modelling.
On the other we regard the article as having the same relationship to
the Record in the model as the reindeer maps website has to the
underlying data it visualises.</li>
<li>There is ontological force in an archivist or record manager making
the judgement that the Record in the model documents a traditional
reindeer herding route. It has archival implications: necessitating that
preservation and availability of this Record take into account its
aspect of documenting the traditional reindeer route, for instance, and
facilitating inter-operability — allowing records on traditional routes
spanning different holders of material to be joined into a stronger
whole. It alsohas legal and political implications: it provides a
concrete, institutionalised ‘hook’ for matters involving traditional
reindeer routes: funding applications, court cases, and so on.</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="6.21" id="weaving-together-fragments"><span
class="header-section-number">6.21</span> Weaving together
fragments</h2>
<p>There is evidence that Sámi lived in the coastal region of Norway
known as Nordmøre in the 1700s and 1800s. References in archival
material, though, are fragmentary. Because of this, the position has
sometimes been taken that it is impossible to include the Sámi within a
narrative of the area’s history: see for instance the controvery
referred to in <a
href="https://www.scup.com/doi/full/10.18261/issn.1894-3195-2017-02-03">this
2017 article</a>, in Norwegian, but with an English abstract.</p>
<p>In RiC, as we noted <a
href="#challenging-over-reliance-on-sources">above</a>, one is free to
form purely intellectual aggregations (a Record Set). These have equal
weight to traditional types of archival aggregations (series, etc) which
reflect physical collections of material. We might take this approach
with the Nordmøre references to Sámi.</p>
<p>We now list some of these references. More can be found <a
href="https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/Samisk_historie_p%C3%A5_Nordm%C3%B8re_og_i_S%C3%B8r-Fosen">here</a>.
This webpage is outside the archival domain at the time of writing, but
the Record Set we shall suggest below could be formed is a way in which
the data underlying the webpage could be brought within into the
archival sphere.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Certain place names, such as <a
href="https://www.norgeskart.no/#!?project=norgeskart&amp;layers=1001&amp;zoom=14&amp;lat=7016041.28&amp;lon=148469.91&amp;sok=finnvika&amp;markerLat=7016069.047372117&amp;markerLon=148944.6058513549&amp;p=searchOptionsPanel&amp;showSelection=false">Finnvika</a>,
near Langøya, a little to the east of Kristiansund, point to the
possible presence of a Sámi community at one time.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several mentions of Sámi people in parish registers and
court records pertaining to Nordmøre or nearby in the 1700s. For example
(all links only in Norwegian):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <a href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/16118/10">court
case</a> concerning an event in Tingvoll in 1732, summarised <a
href="https://gaavnoes.no/2016/04/en-same-avslorer-et-tyveri-i-tingvoll-i-1732/">here</a>.</li>
<li>The <a

href="https://media.digitalarkivet.no/view/16108/122">in Aure</a> on the
31st of May 1791. In both cases the designation “finn” (in its
Danish-Norwegian form “find”) is used, which was more typical for
coastal Sámi.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A <a

RiC can link to it, as we shall illustrate below.</p></li>
<li><p>An <a

<li><p>There are <a
href="https://digitaltmuseum.no/0211814602979/samer-pa-nordmore-en-gang-mer-vanlig-enn-vi-har-trodd">references</a>
to Sámi people in folk material. In a tale with its origins near Hov
church in Sunndalsøra, a Sámi dispatches a problematic human-like troll
(jutul) to the interior of a nearby mountain, with the instruction that
it must remain there until not a hair was left upon a calf-skin, the
troll being permitted to pluck one hair of it each Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>There are influential currents in modern archival theory —
diplomatics, as it known, for instance — which dismiss this kind of
material. for its not lending itself to a scientific analysis of
provenance. RiC, though, allows for all kind of archival contexts,
leaving what to bring in to the judgement and preference of its
users.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The model below gathers together these references. In this way,their
aggregation becomes formalised and institutionalised in an archival
setting. This may enable the material to stand stronger, for the same
kind of reasons as we suggested in the final paragraph of the <a
href="#incorporating-map-data-into-a-sámi-context">previous
section</a>.</p>
<p><a href="diagrams/weaving_fragments.svg"><img
src="diagrams/weaving_fragments.svg" alt="Weaving fragments" /></a></p>
<p>A few notes on the modelling:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In practice, meta-metadata would likely be included in the
modelling: who discovered a particular reference, when it was
discovered, and so on. See <a
href="06--faq--general_questions_and_smaller_modelling_questions.html#do-you-have-examples-illustrating-chapter-6-of-ric-cm">§6.3.3</a>
for more on how this could be done.</li>
<li><a href="https://cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC CRM</a> and other cultural
heritage standards can take over where RiC stops to enrich the
description of the two Thing entities in the model. See <a
href="07--extended_example--cervantes_and_the_printing_of_don_quixote.html#beyond-the-traditional-archival-context">§7.10</a>
for an example of this.</li>
<li>In <a
href="06--faq--record_or_record_set.html#parish-registers">§6.5</a>, we
discussed in detail that a parish register can be viewed as a Record or
Record Set depending upon the context. Above we have modelled each of
the two parish registers as a Record Set, since we primarily view them
as aggregations: apart from the fact that they have records of Sámi
people, what they aggregate is irrelevant for us in the context of the
model.</li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="6.22" id="other-minority-groups"><span
class="header-section-number">6.22</span> Other minority groups</h2>
<p>The issues of material being fragmented and/or underground, and quite
possibly turned on its head where it <em>is</em> to be found, are common
to many minority groups, whether defined by ethnicity, race, sexuality,
religion, or anything else. Techniques which RiC paves the way for, such
as those touched on above, may be helpful in circumventing those
practices which are a primary cause of, and reinforce, these issues —
arising ultimately from mismatches of power, but typically exercised
unconsciously by archivists and record managers going about their daily
work.</p>
