(‘difficult concepts’)</h1>
<h2 id="do-i-have-a-record-resource-record-set-record-or-record-part">Do
I have a record resource, record set, record, or record part?</h2>
<p>The short answer is: don’t worry about it too much! In traditional
settings, the distinction is usually clear: a record might typically be
a paper document of some kind, one</p>
<blockquote>
<p>made or received in the course of a practical activity as an
instrument or a by-product of such activity, and set aside for action or
reference</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in InterPARES’s definition, whereas a record set would consist of
multiple distinct documents.</p>
<p>When it comes to digital-born material, the boundary between a record
and a record set is sometimes harder to pin down. In a table of yearly
import data created by a tax/customs authority, is the entire table a
record, or is each row (corresponding to a single import) a record, and
the table itself rather a record set? Again, it typically doesn’t really
matter too much in practice for RiC, as many attributes and relations in
RiC are common to both records and record sets; if you do wish to make
use of a certain attribute or relation that is only available for one of
them (e.g. <em>is draft of</em> (RiC-R011), only for a record), that is
a strong indication as to which you have!</p>
<p>That said, the table of import data might best be considered a
record, for several reasons. Firstly, the tax/customs authority itself
publishes the table as a whole yearly, it does not publish the
individual rows until that time. Thus, considering the entire table as a
record better reflects the reality that it was under continual creation
by the tax/customs authority during the year. Secondly, the rows of such
a table will typically be expressed in a certain format, often quite
compact and tightly defined, that was designed for the table as a whole
— for recording of import activity in general. The rows are subsumed by
this overall schema.</p>
<p>As RiC-CM puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most prominent difference in the description of record set and
record is that the identity of the record is directly derived from the
record itself… Similarly, the identity of [a] record part is dependent
on and derived from the record of which it is a part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be useful to compare to similar examples for analogue
material. A yearly table of import data is not too dissimilar to a
parish register; this would certainly traditionally be considered a
record, whereas each individual entry of a baptism, marriage, or death
would not be.</p>
<p>When such analogies are not readily apparent, the fact that a record
has an aspect of ‘wholeness’ or ‘completeness’ will likely be the best
guide. For instance, an entire relational database might best be
considered a record, not a record set, as the tables are typically
intertwined by foreign keys and defined by an overall schema; usage of
the database (querying it) may well necessitate joins across tables,
whilst adding the data of one input event might involve insertion into
several tables.</p>
<p>Not having too narrow a conception of record can be practically very
helpful. Having fewer records with a higher quality of archival
description will likely lead to a richer context and easier discovery of
material. It will also likely make a transition to RiC from an older
paradigm easier.</p>
<p>In previous approaches to archival description, positioning record
sets at different hierarchical levels (fonds, series, …) has been
important. This is much less of true of RiC, which allows for
considerable flexibility in describing the structure of record sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any kind of hierarchy can be expressed by means of properties such
as <em>includes or included</em> (RiC-R024).</li>
<li>To express sequences, one has <em>follows or followed</em>
(RiC-R008i) and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, although RiC does have an attribute Record Set Type
(RiC-A36) available to categorise a record set, one need not be hasty in
using it. The spirit of RiC is much more towards simply identifying that
one has a record set, and then elaborating upon its structure to the
degree appropriate in a given context.</p>
<p>RiC’s notion of a record part (RiC-E05) too is very flexible: it
could be a page of a document or an email attachment, but also a line or
a word. In the import activity example above, it might be an entire row,
or an entry in one column of that row. In the relational database
example, it might be an entire table, a row in one of the tables, an
entry in one such row, or a structural aspect such as a foreign key.</p>
<p>What of a record resource (RiC-E02)? This is more of a placeholder,
convenient at a meta-level for when one does not need or wish to specify
whether one has a record set, record, or record part. It is used
frequently in this way both in RiC-CM and RiC-O. When it comes to actual
data, whilst there can be use-cases for record resource, it should
likely rarely be used; one should rather make a choice as to whether one
has a record set or a record (in the given context).</p>
<p>Instantiations (RiC-E06) have little bearing upon whether we have a
record set, record, or record part, but a point sometimes overlooked is
that consideration of instantiations is relevant for many kinds of
record set, not only records. One can perfectly well consider the
digitisation of an entire photo collection, for instance, the
instantiation being a digital photo album. Or the digitisation of all of
the material in a fonds, not only specific series or records, the
instantiation being a HTML page which serves as a landing page for
accessing the digitised material (i.e. with all of the digitised at
least implicitly linked to it).</p>
<p>All this is despite the fact that RiC-CM does not (unlike for a
record) <em>require</em> that a record set have an instantiation. This
is to allow for groupings/aggregations of records that are meaningful
intellectually, but not reflected in a physical gathering of material:
the private papers of a certain individual might for instance be split
between two different institutions, each half having an instantiatiation
(certain files on a shelf of their holding institution), whilst the
whole does not, at least in the context of, say, curation.</p>
<p>A second point worth emphasising is that RiC allows for flexibility
in the description of the structure of an instantiation too. For
instance, the relation <em>has or had component</em> (RiC-R004) can be
used for instantiations in a very similar way as <em>includes or
included</em> (RiC-R024) for record sets.</p>
<h2
id="do-i-have-an-activity-or-an-event-can-i-ignore-both-to-begin-with">Do
I have an Activity or an Event? Can I ignore both to begin with?</h2>
<p>To consider the second question first, if one is coming to RiC from
an earlier approach to archival description, it is quite conceivable
that Event (RiC-E14) and Activity (RiC-E15) are those entities which one
will take into use last. Yet they are perhaps the key entities for fully
opening up the rich possibilities that RiC offers!</p>
<p>Take for instance what is known as ‘functional provenance’: the
‘practical activity’ of the InterPARES definition of a record above.
Traditionally, this might well have been incorporated into an archival
description in an unstructured way, in free-text notes. RiC fully allows
for continuation of this practice by means of the attribute Scope and
Content (RiC-A38) — one of RiC’s characteristics in general is that one
does not need to make a seismic shift to it from an older archival
description paradigm, it allows for bridging the two gradually.</p>
<p>But it is the relation <em>documents</em> (RiC-R033), which has the
Activity (RiC-E15) entity as its range, that is specifically intended to
detail the ‘practical activity’ out of which a record arises. Expressing
functional provenance in this structured way has several benefits.
Firstly, it allows for precise use of it in exploration of and search
amongst archival descriptions. For example, if ‘school administration’
(in a certain geographical or political domain) is the practical
activity, expressing this using <em>documents</em> would allow for
answering questions such as: which record sets documenting school
administration were created between 2000 and 2010?</p>
<p>Secondly, an Activity can itself be described by means of a number of
relations and attributes. For example, <em>affects or affected</em>
(RiC-R059), which in the school administration example could be made use
of to list those schools within scope; or <em>is or was subevent of</em>
(RiC-R006i), which might be used to view school administration as a
special case of municipal (say) administration. In this way the activity
becomes part of a rich context.</p>
<p>But Activity (RiC-E15) has considerably broader applicability. In
fact, as a rule of thumb, if you are not sure how to model something in
RiC, try Activity! Digitisation, appraisal, accrual, arranging,
publishing, …; it can be used for all of these, indeed for most aspects
of everyday archival practice.</p>
<p>A typical pattern would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>One uses <em>is or was affected by</em> (RiC-R059i) to connect an
activity to a record set, record, record part, or instantiation.</li>
<li>One uses <em>results or resulted in</em> (RiC-R061) to describe the
outcome of this activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Digitisation, for example, would affect one instantiation (a paper
document, say) of a record, and result in a second instantiation (an
electronic file, say) of the same record. Whilst appraisal would affect
a certain record set, and might result in a new activity affecting the
same record set, namely its accrual.</p>
<p>In all such uses of Activity, relations such as <em>is or was
performed by</em> (RiC-R060), <em>is or was regulated by</em>
(RiC-R063i), or <em>occurred at date</em> (RiC-R080i), noting that a
Date (RiC-E18) can very well be a period of time in RiC, will very often
be used to record important details of the activity.</p>
<p>Let us turn now to the question of whether one has an Activity or
only an Event (RiC-E14), the former being a more specific case of the
latter. In short, it is very likely one has an Activity, and that this
should be used! It is easy to be a little tricked ordinary language, and
muse that an appraisal, say, might be more of a one-off event than an
activity. But RiC-CM stresses that an event may very well be a
continuous endeavour that lasts a period of time, and the key sentence
in RiC-CM (in the presentation of RiC-E14) is that an activity is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an agent-designed and performed event that has an intended purpose or
purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost any aspect of archival practice will likely fall under
this.</p>
<p>Any relations with Event as their domain are equally applicable for
Activity. In particular, this is the case for <em>has or had
subevent</em> (RiC-R006), which is very useful for, say, relating
digitisation of a certain record set to digitisation in general.</p>
<p>A typical use of an event which is not an activity would be in
connection with <em>is associated with event</em> (RiC-R057i), relating
a record or record set to a certain moment of history; Lord Halifax’s
diaries could be connected to the Second World War, for instance. Whilst
such events themselves are outside the realm of archival practice, they
very useful for placing a record or record set in a rich thematic
context that facilitates their discovery.</p>
