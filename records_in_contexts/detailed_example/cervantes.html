<h1 id="cervantes-and-the-printing-of-don-quixote">Cervantes and the
printing of Don Quixote</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In 1604, on the 11th of September in Valladolid, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Herrera_y_Tordesillas">Antonio
de Herrera y Tordesillas</a> wrote, in response to a memorial pertaining
to the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote">Don
Quixote</a> submitted to the Consejo de Castilla (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Castile">Council of
Castile</a>) by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes">Miguel de
Cervantes</a>, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>se le podrá dar licencia para imprimille [a license to print it
should be granted].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/12631375?nm">two
records</a> — Cervantes’ memorial and Herrera’s report — are of rather
complex provenance, and fit into a rich context. We shall explore here
how RiC and a couple of complementary standards can express aspects of
this.</p>
<h2 id="councils">Councils</h2>
<p>By the time Cervantes wrote his memorial, the kingdoms of Castile and
Aragon, though still to a large degree distinct, had had a single
monarch since the marriage of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_I_of_Castile">Queen
Isabella I of Castile</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon">King
Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> in the 15th century. In addition to making up
roughly the mainland of modern Spain, the kingdoms — the one or the
other — controlled what is now referred to as the Spanish empire
(including much of the Americas and considerable parts of Europe).</p>
<p>Governance was through entities known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynodial_System">councils</a>
(consejos): one each originally for Castile and Aragon, these pre-dating
the unification of their crowns. Gradually numerous councils were split
off from these two, being given responsibility either for a particular
territory, for example the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_Indies">Council of
the Indies</a> (Consejo de las Indias) — which we shall return to later
— or for a particular function, for example the Council of Finance
(Consejo de Hacienda), both with origins in the Council of Castile.
Councils were also created from scratch, the most important of which had
both kingdoms in their remit, for example
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Council_of_State">Council
of State</a> (Consejo de Estado).</p>
<p>That Herrera was in Vallodolid places our two records at a quite
specific point in time: the royal court in Castile, to which the Council
of Castile was attached, had been in Madrid for several decades until
1601, and moved to Valladolid only from 1601 to 1606, whereupon it moved
permanently back to Madrid. This event is of archival significance
because, in conjunction with the move, a transfer of some records of the
Council of Castile to Simancas was made, along with records of certain
of the other councils.</p>
<h2 id="simancas">Simancas</h2>
<p>Let us pause to discuss the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo_General_de_Simancas">General
Archive of Simancas</a> (Archivo General de Simancas) a little; it is of
first-rank importance both for its holdings and for its history. By
default, one would typically regard an archive as a <em>Corporate
Body</em> (RiC-E11), namely as an institution working with archival
material; in this sense, the General Archive of Simancas was founded
around sixty years before Cervantes’ request, as we shall discuss in
more detail below. Secondly, it usually has a physical location,
<em>Place</em> (RiC-E22) in RiC, and may be identified with it; in the
case of the General Archive of Simancas, its purpose-built location
within the pre-existing Castle of Simancas is regarded as having being
completed in the 1580s. Thirdly, one might regard it as (an enormous!)
<em>Record Set</em> (RiC-E03), i.e. identify it with its collection of
records. Such a point of view goes beyond the boundaries of some
traditional points of view upon archival description which might have
fonds as the broadest entity, but has been made use of in practice long
before RiC — we shall touch upon an example later — and will be useful
to us.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/general_archive_of_simancas.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/general_archive_of_simancas.svg"
alt="General archive of Simancas" /></a></p>
<p>The date given in the diagram for the founding of the General Archive
of Simancas comes from a <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/12883369?nm">royal
decree</a> of the 16th of September 1540. This record stipulates that
certain documents be sent to one Juan Mosquera de Molina, who — this is
the crucial point, Simancas not being mentioned explicitly — was an
official (alcaide: commandant/warden) at the Castle of Simancas. We
could embellish the above diagram as follows to capture this, recalling
that <em>has or had authority over</em> (RiC-R036) only implies some
kind of authority, not over-arching authority. Included is the nuance
that the decree was actually written (apart from the king’s signature)
by <a
href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_V%C3%A1zquez_de_Molina">Juan
Vázquez de Molina</a>, in Flanders as it happens (though we do not
include this in the diagram!).</p>

alt="General archive of Simancas — royal decree" /></a></p>
<h2 id="records-of-the-council-of-castile-i">Records of the Council of
Castile I</h2>
<p>Although both diagrams above refer, for simplicity, simply to the
Collection of the Council of Castile, and although this Record Set is <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/117085">referred
to</a> in existing archival descriptions as a fonds, it actually
encompasses only a small proportion of the archived records of the
Council of Castile. Apart from those which were sent, as mentioned
earlier, to Simancas in 1606, others, mainly older and including those
specified in the founding royal decree of 1540, were organised, and it
seems largely collected by the industry of, Diego de Ayala, who by
another royal decree was installed as an archivist at the Castle of
Simancas in 1561 (initially along with a second archivist, but the
latter died in 1563) — this work was of invaluable importance! More or
less everything else (which was not lost) travelled to Madrid with the
royal court.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/records_of_the_council_of_castile.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/records_of_the_council_of_castile.svg"
alt="Records of the Council of Castile" /></a></p>
<p>Any modelling in RiC, such as that expressed by the above diagram, is
to be understood as having an ‘open-world semantics’: more information
could always be added to it, no matter how high a degree of nuance and
accuracy might be achieved. Here we could for example include details of
the royal decree mandating Diego de Ayala’s position of head archivist
at Simancas. Or if we were to obtain more details on the accruals to
Simancas, for example those created after 1606, further Record Sets
could be added.</p>
<p>Technical points of note in the diagram include the following.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The distinction between <em>has end date</em> (RO71i) and <em>has
or had all members with creation date</em> (R081i) for a Record Set.
Archival descriptions have often been ambiguous about which is meant: a
Record Set might well have been ‘open’ for a period of time — for
example as long as an organisation existed if the Record Set documents
the activities of that organisation — since the last record belonging to
it was created. With regard to the diagram, the fact that all of the
records of the Council of Castile held at Simancas were created between
1437 and 1648 <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/117085">comes
from PARES</a>; whereas we have not researched when the last record
arranged by Diego de Ayala was created, but the set of such records
certainly ends with his death. In general, <em>has or had all members
with creation date</em> or one of its variants (<em>has or had most
members with creation date</em> (R083i) for instance), can always be
used, even if the end date of the specified period time is not exact,
but it is preferable to be precise where one can.</p></li>
<li><p>Free use has been made of the Record Set entity as an
intellectual abstraction. A Record Set indeed, unlike a Record
(RiC-E04), is not required in RiC to have an Instantiation (RiC-E06),
and one reason for this is precisely so as to allow for its usage in
expressing context, as in the diagram; the records arranged by Diego de
Ayala, for example, do all have a physical incarnation, and sub-groups
of them are physically stored together in Ayala’s arrangement, but the
diagram does not require or imply that the entirety of these records are
stored physically together, or even identifiable as a single entity in
the storage metadata. On the other hand, a Record Set certainly can be
regarded as having an Instantiation, this being the case in PARES for
the totality records of the Council at Castile held at Simancas, for
example.</p></li>
<li><p>A couple of the Activities in the diagram are specified as having
an Activity Type corresponding to fundamental archival processes:
Arrangement and Accrual. Classifying by means of Activity Type in this
way is important both for inter-operability and for allowing orientation
of data around specific aspects of archival work, without privileging
any of them. Canonical vocabularies for Activity Type, and other
attributes, are planned for RiC as a supplement to RiC-CM and RiC-O.</p>
<p>In the diagram, Event is used in one case, and Activity in all the
others. RiC-CM gives the difference between the two as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An Activity is an agent designed and performed event that has an
intended purpose or purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Event in the diagram, the movement of the royal court to Madrid,
had archival consequences, but these can hardly be said to have been
part of the reason for the move; whereas all of the Activities in the
diagram specifically pertain to archives, and a definite archival
purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>As is almost always the case in RiC, a property can be used more
than once, as <em>has or had location</em> (RiC-R075i) is in the
diagram. The philosophy is one of facilitating discovery: somebody
encountering that the fact that the Habsburg royal court is described as
having both Valladolid and Madrid as locations would, if it is relevant
for them, be prompted to dig more deeply into the context to understand
why both are listed (that the royal was court, that this had archival
ramifications, and so on).</p>
<p>Whilst we did not include this in the diagram, RiC allows for
decoration of relations by means of certain relation attributes. For
instance, <em>Date of Relation</em> (RiC-RA02) could certainly be used
in conjunction with <em>has or had location</em> to express that the
court was at Valladolid from 1601 to 1606, and similarly for Madrid.
RiC-O makes use of a technical device known as an n-ary relation class —
factoring of an object property through an individual for which
properties such as a Date can be defined — to allow for relation
attributes; it could look as follows in this case, where
rico:PlaceRelation is the n-ary relation class, and the relation <em>is
associated with place</em> (R074i), of which <em>has or had
location</em> is a sub-relation, becomes a ‘shortcut’ for the path
consisting of the two horizontal arrows (we mean this only informally
here, but it is also true in a formal sense in RiC-O, albeit one more
arrow is needed to express it — we shall not go into this
here).</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="records-of-the-council-of-castile-ii">Records of the Council of
Castile II</h2>
<p>Cervantes’ memorial and Herrera’s report were amongst those records
which moved with the royal court to Madrid. Literature was censored in
Habsburg Spain at the time, and requests for licenses for printing were
handled by Escribanías de Cámara y Justicia (Notaries of the Chamber and
Justice); over the next couple of centuries the records remained at the
part of court handling matters of justice. The Ancien Régime gradually
fell, and the Council of Castile ceased to exist in 1834; the Tribunal
Supremo (Supreme Court), enshrined in Spain’s constitution of 1812, took
over its role with respect to justice, and in particular as gatekeeper
of records pertaining to justice.</p>
<p>It would take us too far afield to delve into the details, but
suffice it to say that the Council of Castile’s records at court fell
over the years into a state of a certain degree of neglect. The need for
their archival was recognised, but Simancas no longer had space to
receive records; omitting the details of various earlier alleviations,
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historical_Archive_(Spaini)">Archivo
Histórico Nacional</a> (National Historical Archive) was constructed in
the second half of the nineteenth century, and eventually (between 1896
and 1899), the fonds of the Council of Castile held at the Supreme Court
(and elsewhere if not at Simancas) were sent there. Specifically,
Cervantes’ memorial and Herrera’s report belonged to a series already
compiled by the 1730s, known as the <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/7306718">Archivo
Antiguo de Consejo. Consultas y Decretos</a> (Ancient Archive of the
Council. Consultations and Decrees).</p>
<p><a
href="../diagrams/transfer_to_national_historical_archive.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/transfer_to_national_historical_archive.svg"
alt="Transfer to Archivo Histórico Nacional" /></a></p>
<h2 id="extraction-of-cervantes-memorial">Extraction of Cervantes’
memorial</h2>
<p>This is not quite the end of the story when it comes to the
provenance of Cervantes’ memorial and Herrera’s report. In the 1980s,
archivists at Archivo Histórico Nacional extracted into what is regarded
as a new Record Set, <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/12631375?nm">Colección
de pergaminos y documentos del Consejo de Castilla</a>, certain records
of the Council of Castile whose instantiations were regarded as
particularly vulnerable from a conservation or display point of view.
Cervantes’ memorial and Herrera’s report were amongst these.</p>
<p>As is drawn attention to in PARES, the creation of this Record Set a
priori did not adhere to the principle of preservation of organic
provenance (although it should be noted that much in this regard had
already been lost by the time of the transfer to Archivo Histórico
Nacional — the situation was not necessarily much ameliorated, it seems,
by the arrangement of the records at the archive following the move).
RiC’s concept of a Record Set, though, fully encompasses a collection
defined according to these criteria, and the decentralised nature of RiC
means that the provenance can be as accurately expressed as in a
traditional hierarchical example.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/extraction_of_cervantes_memorial.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/extraction_of_cervantes_memorial.svg"
alt="Extraction of Cervantes’ memorial" /></a></p>
<p>Given that RiC makes a careful distinction between record resources
(in their three guises) and their instantiations, one might at first
balk a little at our referring to ‘extraction of records’: is not the
Cervantes memorial the same intellectually as it always was, and the
extraction purely a matter of the storage and handling of its original
instantiation? The key point is that a record as an intellectual entity
is more than the substance of its contents; all aspects of its
provenance, and context more generally as far as it is relevant
archivally, are a part of it too. That certain instantiations of a
record are deemed of such vulnerability as for this to be of relevance
for an archivist in working with it (making it available to the public,
for instance) is certainly a judgement of sufficient weight as to
justify introducing an intellectual entity (Record Set) which
specifically aggregrates them, as the Archivo Histórico Nacional did.
From a practical point of view, one has the possibility to introduce an
Instantiation of this new Record Set, which would be a natural entity to
which to tie details of how one handles the vulnerabilities of the
records.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-heritage-aspects">Cultural heritage aspects</h2>
<p>RiC’s domain extends to the content of records in a direct way only
in so far as this has immediate archival implications: the subject or
subjects of a record, for instance, are likely to be of importance (to
enable the record to be discovered), but broader intellectual
interpretation or reflection would typically be out of scope archivally.
RiC fully allows, though, to pass in a structured way to the broader
cultural heritage domain.</p>
<p>Cervantes’ memorial, for instance, contains his signature. This is
significant for several reasons, not least with regard to questions of
authenticity. We can highlight its importance by expressing it as a
Record Part (RiC-E05), but to more specifically indicate its nature, we
can view it as a <a
href="http://cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/7.1.3/E37_Mark">Mark (E37)</a> as
defined in the cultural heritage standard <a
href="https://cidoc-crm.org/">CIDOC CRM</a>. To enable this, we view
Cervantes’ memorial as a <a
href="http://cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/7.1.3/E31_Document">Document
(E31)</a> in the CIDOC sense, in addition to as a Record in RiC; view
Cervantes himself as an <a
href="http://cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/7.1.3/E39_Actor">Actor (E39)</a> in
the CIDOC sense, in addition to as a Person in RiC; and make use of the
CIDOC properties <em>shows visual item</em> (P65) and <em>is identified
by</em> (P1). One could go much further in this direction!</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/cervantes_signature.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/cervantes_signature.svg"
alt="Cervantes’ signature" /></a></p>
<h2 id="records-pertaining-to-the-ransoming-of-cervantes">Records
pertaining to the ransoming of Cervantes</h2>
<p>Cervantes crops up in the archives of the various Councils in
different ways, not only in the writing of the memorial on the printing
of Don Quixote. Thus he becomes a relation between different fonds which
would be lost in hierarchical points of view on archival description. We
turn now to exploring one example of this, and to how RiC allows us to
formulate it.</p>
<p>Cervantes had an eventful life! In the early 1570s he served as a
soldier, but was captured at sea, along with his brother, by pirates in
1575, and held for ransom in Algiers for several years thereafter.
Cervantes’ mother, Leonor de Cortinas worked to free her sons; amongst
other records of her endeavours, she submitted a memorial to the <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46764">Council
of War</a> (one of the territory-wide councils which took form in the
1500s) in 1578, requesting merchandise of value 8000 ducats towards
paying off the ransom, in view of Cervantes’ known good service. We are
unsure if the memorial itself exists in the archives at Simancas, or is
known only by reference (in which case it is a good example of how a
Record can be relevant for an archival description, even when an
Instantiation of it may not be held by any of the relevant archival
institutions), but the <a
href="https://www.cultura.gob.es/va/dam/jcr:cb292c05-5e31-43df-95aa-c7ca05bcdd9b/18-gym-lib-34-2-66.pdf">Council
of War’s response</a> granting 2000 ducats at least is held there.</p>
<p>The archives of the <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/46286">Council
of the Indies</a>, held at the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Archive_of_the_Indies">Archivo
General de Indias</a>, meanwhile contain the Record Set <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/126853">Expediente
sobre los méritos y servicios de Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra</a>, two
of the records of which date from 1578 and are directly related, in
different ways, to the question of Cervantes’ release. One is based upon
information provided by Cervantes’ father, Rodrigo de Cervantes.
Incidentally, this Record Set (file) would appear to be another example
where a different principle of organisation than organic provenance has
been followed in the archiving of it; being able to place it in a
broader context as we do here allows to break free of the choices made
in that archiving, whilst remaining faithful to the reality of its
existence. This is equally so at a slightly higher level: whilst one of
the four records in this Record Set (we will not consider it otherwise
here) would naturally have been the domain of the Council of the Indies,
it is not immediately obvious that this was the case for the two records
we are interested in!</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/cervantes_ransom.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/cervantes_ransom.svg"
alt="Concerning Cervantes’ ransom" /></a></p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-traditional-archival-context">Beyond the traditional
archival context</h2>
<p>The use of archives — in any form: in legal matters, for research, …
— situates the archival domain in a very broad context. Whilst this is
not itself within RiC’s scope, RiC does allow for building a bridge to
it, as we shall now explore in a couple of examples.</p>
<p>In Spain, a project resulting in an online catalogue, <a
href="https://pares.cultura.gob.es/metapares/inicio">MetaPARES</a>, was
carried out a few years to link archival material to scholarly documents
citing it. Whilst the project is at the time of writing not fully
realised, there are already <a
href="https://pares.cultura.gob.es/metapares/generalSearchForm?textGen=Cervantes&amp;pagNum=1&amp;pagSize=10">quite
a number</a> of entries pertaining to Cervantes, for example.</p>
<p><a
href="https://pares.cultura.gob.es/metapares/vistaunica?id=235742522">One
of them</a> concerns an <a
href="https://analescervantinos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/analescervantinos/article/view/325">article
from 2016</a> bringing to light new biographical details on Cervantes,
these coming from certain records held at the Archivo General de Indias.
The article contains within it transcriptions of these records. By
bringing this article into our archival description context as we do
below, we allow for discovery of these transcriptions, and thus in the
end the archival context, not only the broader cultural heritage one, is
enriched.</p>
<p><a href="../diagrams/new_biographical_details.svg"><img
src="../diagrams/new_biographical_details.svg"
alt="New biographical details" /></a></p>
<p>Here, in addition to RiC, we have made use of the <a
href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/bibo/">Bibliographic
Ontology</a>, <a
href="https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/">Dublin
Core</a>, and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-schema/">RDF
schema</a>. A few points of note:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We have modelled the transcription of the record included in the
diagram only as an Instantiation. As RiC-CM indicates, it is a matter of
judgement whether an Instantiation derived from another can be regarded
as an instantiation of a new Record (as well as being an instantiation
of the original one). A transcription typically <em>would</em> be
regarded as giving rise to a new Record, as significant intellectual
endeavour may well be involved in a transcription, and recording of the
context of that endeavour is then important archivally (allowing for the
exploration of questions of bias, for instance). In the setting of the
diagram, though, the transcription is only included within the text of
the research article in question, and as such not quite within the
archival domain as such, for which Record in the RiC sense should be
reserved.</li>
<li>We see how Thing (RiC-E01) is useful to make the bridge between RiC
and other domains: although one should always use a more specific entity
within the archival domain, several relations in RiC allow for Thing in
their domain, range, or both, and, as in the diagram, it can be very
useful to use these relations in cases where only one of the domain and
the range are archival entities.</li>
<li>The diagram illustrates how RiC allows for the archival domain to
make contact with broader conceptions of Document: from a bibliographic
point of view, the cited Record in question is no more than any other
Document, but from an archival point of view it is essential to know
that it is something more!</li>
</ol>
<p>We give one more example. The intellectual <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A1maso_Alonso">Dámaso Alonso y
Fernández de las Redondas</a> studied various records in the reading
rooms of the Archivo Histórico Nacional, his research, as in many such
cases, leading to the record <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/description/13002913">Expediente
de investigación del Archivo Histórico Nacional correspondiente a Dámaso
Alonso Fernández de las Redondas</a> (Research file of the Archivo
Histórico Nacional relating to Dámaso Alonso Fernández de las Redondas).
Because of this and his relation to several other records, Dámaso Alonso
is recorded as an <a
href="https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/autoridad/142688?nm">agent</a>
within PARES.</p>
<p>Not apparent from the PARES description, though, is the fact that
Alonso was also a noted Cervantes scholar, for example writing the essay
“Oscillation in the character of Sancho” in 1969. By bringing this into
the context, we again open for discovery of influences that may be of
archival or literary significance.</p>
