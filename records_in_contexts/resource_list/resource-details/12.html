      <h2><img class="resource-details-icon" src="../icons/web_application.svg" alt="Application"/>A prototype of an intuitive research interface, allowing to explore and query a knowledge graph of significant size, that conforms to RiC-O (slightly extended) and was produced from the metadata that describe a part of the public records produced by the Parisian notaries from the XVth century and kept by the Archives nationales de France</h2>

        <li><p>This demonstrator, which uses the current version of <a href='https://sparnatural.eu/'>Sparnatural</a>, a visual SPARQL query editor, is the result of an exploratory work on the transition from archival metadata to data graphs, following the projects of qualitative proof of concept PIAAF (released in February 2018) and development of the RiC-O Converter  software (version 1.0 released in April 2020). The main challenge of the project was to provide users with a relevant and accessible research interface to explore an archival metadata graph of significant size, which exploits its nature.Through this prototype, built with Sparnatural, you can query a knowledge graph created from a part of the metadata describing the archives of Paris notaries kept at the French national Archives. These metadata have been semantized according to the ontology Records In Contexts (RiC-O). The prototype is composed of two research interfaces. Interface A offers a simple and general exploration interface in this metadata, which could be used for other archival metadata. Interface B offers an exploration interface in these metadata based on the specificities of notarial archives. Note that the IRIs of RDF resources are currently not dereferenceable.</p></li>
