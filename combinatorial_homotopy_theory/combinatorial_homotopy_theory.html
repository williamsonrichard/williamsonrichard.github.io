Advanced course given in Autumn 2012. The notes cover the first two lectures. They will eventually be expanded to include the remaining lectures, and the numerous typos corrected.

<p>
The lectures not yet written up outlined a construction of a model structure upon cubical sets with connections, and the construction of a Quillen equivalence between this model structure and the Serre model structure upon spaces.

Abstract
</h2>

<p>
An idea of profound importance in homotopy theory is that we can model homotopy types by gadgets which are of a very different character to topological spaces. First among these are presheaf models, the most well known being simplicial sets. One can think of a presheaf model of a homotopy type as akin to a CW-complex, with better categorical properties.
</p>

<p>
The course will present this classical idea with a twist &mdash; we will work in the main not with simplicial sets but with cubical sets. I will develop the homotopy theory of cubical sets from scratch, building up to a proof that it is 'equivalent' to that of topological spaces, in a sense which we will explore along the way.
</p>

<p>
The prerequisites are few. Familiarity and comfort with categories would be helpful, as would a little rudimentary algebraic topology (homotopy groups, for example).
