I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjIuWTOIy4Q">recording</a> of the poem in song form in September 2023, along with its <a href="waves_etched-I.html">companion poem</a>.

As with <a href="waves_etched-I.html">this poem</a>, written on the morning of the 26th of July 2023, looking out over the same bay at Flakstad in Lofoten as when I wrote <a href="disturbance.html">Disturbance</a>. Inspired by waves observed there the previous night, as well as the landscape of Leka.
