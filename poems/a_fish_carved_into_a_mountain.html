Originally composed on the morning of the 25th of July 2023, whilst running from Flakstad to Bø in Lofoten. Inspired by a mountain there, and a stockfish rack near Ramberg. The final two lines were altered on the 7-9th of August 2023, and experimented with them again in September 2025 (reverting these changes in November 2025!), though the principal imagery and the idea of them has always been the same.
