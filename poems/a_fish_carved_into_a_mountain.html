A fish carved into a mountain<br>
by geological means.

Originally composed on the morning of the 25th of July 2023, whilst running from Flakstad to BÃ¸ in Lofoten. Inspired by a mountain there, and a stockfish rack near Ramberg. The poem originally contained two further lines, which were altered on the 7-9th of August 2023 (though the principal imagery and the idea of them was the same) and removed in August 2025.
