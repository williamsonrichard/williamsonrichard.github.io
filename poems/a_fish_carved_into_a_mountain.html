Originally composed on the morning of the 25th of July 2023, whilst running from Flakstad to BÃ¸ in Lofoten. Inspired by a mountain there, and a stockfish rack near Ramberg. The final two lines were altered on the 7-9th of August 2023, and again in September 2025, though the principal imagery and the idea of them has always been the same.
