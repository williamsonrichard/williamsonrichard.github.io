<h3>
Her — Extract 2
</h3>

<p>
you fill your coat-pockets<br>
with bits of the forest floor<br>
pine-cones sticks stones nuts<br>
like a squirrel<br>
stockpiling for the winter<br>
it's squirrels that plant most trees<br>
they forget where they've buried their nuts<br>
so they're left lying<br>
under the earth<br>
and sprout

<h3>
Ho — Utdrag 2
</h3>

<p>
du fyller jakkelommene<br>
med gjenstandar frå skogbotnen<br>
konglar pinnar steinar nøtter<br>
som eit ekorn<br>
samlar saman til vinteren<br>
det er ekorn som plantar dei fleste tre<br>
dei gløymer kor dei har grave ned nøttene sine<br>
så dei blir liggende<br>
under jorda<br>
og spire

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Etymologically, "jakke" would correspond to "jacket" rather than "coat", but "jakke" is used somewhat generically in Norwegian, in much the same way as "coat" is in English: the default term.
</p>
<p>
In «Ho» as a whole, the "you" figure's coat has already been introduced, so that the definite form of "jakkelommene" ("coat-pockets") partly refers back to this. There is any case a question of whether to translate to "the coat-pockets" or "your coat-pockets" in English; the definite noun form is very flexible in Norwegian, and is often not appropriate to translate entirely literally.
</p>
<p>
Here there is certainly, I feel, an implicit possessive in "jakkelommene", and whilst "the coat-pockets" is not impossible, "your coat-pockets" feels more natural.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The noun "gjenstandar" arises as a compound which literally corresponds to something like "still-standings", without a precise counterpart in English. A possible translation of "gjenstandar frå" could be to "items from" or "things from", but "bits of" seems best poetically.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The same remarks apply to the rendering of "skogbotnen" to "forest floor" here as I made in the translation of <a href="jordfeilbrytaren_feilar.html">Extract 1</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In translating "samlar saman", there is a choice to be made between the simple present ("stockpiles") or the present continuous ("stockpiling"). The latter allows for a reading, also possible in the original Norwegian, which refers not only to the squirrel but also to the "you"-figure, whilst "stockpiles" would only be a part of the squirrel simile. For this reason "stockpiling" seems preferable; it is also slightly more energetic, which fits well with the first line.
</p>

<p>
The phrase "samlar saman" would literally correspond (in the present continuous) to "collecting together" or "gathering together", but has a naturality that in this context these English phrases lack. A translation to "gathering up" would be better, but still does not feel quite right.
</p>

<p>
A possibility would be to simply translate to "gathering for (the) winter", but this does not fully reflect the nuance expressed by the inclusion of "saman" ("together" or, here, "up"). A translation to "amassing" is also a possibility, but feels a little incomplete in isolation; "stockpiling" has something of the sense of both "gathering" and "amassing", and fits well, I feel, rhythmically and tonally.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The "som" in "ekorn som" could possibly translate instead to "who" or "which", but "that" feels clearly best here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the original, one has "har grave ned", which more literally would translate to "have dug down" rather than "have buried", but the latter feels natural here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The phrase "blir liggende" would literally correspond to "be lying", which is not really possible here in English except in a dialectical or archaic context. The sense is that of "remain", which has a root in Middle and Old English corresponding to something like "be left", and thus is not all that far from "blir liggende" etymologically; "they remain" is thus certainly a possibility, but "they're left lying" feels slightly closer to the original both syntactically and poetically. A third possibility would be "they remain lying", but this feels a little clunky.

<p>
Extract 2 is from page 13 of my edition, the ninth page of the poem itself. It is almost the entirety of that page, but I have omitted the first line on the page, which makes a reference to an earlier passage in «Ho».
