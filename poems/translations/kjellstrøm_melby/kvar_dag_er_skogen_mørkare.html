every day the forest is darker<br>
colder<br>
you shower for a long time under the warm water<br>
until the pressure loosens

Ho — Utdrag 5

<p>
kvar dag er skogen mørkare<br>
kaldare<br>
du dusjar lenge under det varme vatnet<br>
til trykket lausnar

Notes
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
One could translate "kvar dag" to "each day", but "every day" feels more natural rhythmically.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Literally, "lenge" would translate simply to "long", which is probably just about possible in English, but feels a little awkward; similarly, one could just about omit the "for" at the beginning of "for a long time", but again it does not quite feel right. The full "for a long time" seems the most natural choice.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Though "loosens" is somewhat unusual in this context, "lausnar" is equally so in the original Norwegian; it is a rather literal translation, which in this case I feel allows for the most faithful rendering of the nuances of the poetry.

Extract 5 is from page 14 of my edition, the tenth page of the poem itself. It comprises the first four lines of that page.
