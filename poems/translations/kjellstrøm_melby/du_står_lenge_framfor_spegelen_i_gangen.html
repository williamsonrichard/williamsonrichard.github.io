Translation

<h3>
Her — Extract 4
</h3>

<p>
you stand for a long time in front of the mirror in the hallway<br>
searching for remains of the summer<br>
in your freckles which disappeared in the autumn<br>
instead a fern of blue-green blood vessels<br>
over your whole body
</p>

<h3>
Ho — Utdrag 4
</h3>

<p>
du står lenge framfor speglen i gangen<br>
leitar etter restar av sommaren<br>
i freknene dine som forsvann i haust<br>
i staden eit ormegras av blågrøne blodårer<br>
over heile kroppen din
</p>

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
The verb "å stå" ("to stand") is used quite flexibly in Norwegian, and is often best translated to something like "to wait" or "to pause". Here, though, I feel that the direct translation best reflects the original.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One could also translate "gangen" to "the corridor" or "the hall", but "the hallway" is more everyday than "the hall", which better reflects the tone of the original, whilst a "hallway" feels slightly more appropriate than "corridor" in the context of the lines: the presence of the mirror, and so on.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The verb "leitar" could be translated either with the simple present ("search") or the present continuous ("searching"), but I feel that the energy of the latter is more faithful to the original.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One might translate "i staden" to "in their place", but "instead" is more faithful to the original syntactically, and its concision works well rhythmically.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Literally, "ormegras" could be rendered "snakegrass", but, though evocative, it is in fact a standard term for "fern" in Norwegian, and a simple translation to the latter serves the poetry best here, I feel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One could translate "blodårer" to "veins", but I feel that the more literal translation to "blood vessels" is preferable rhythmically here, as well as being syntactically close to the original.
