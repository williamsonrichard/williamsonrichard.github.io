<h3>
Everything
</h3>

<p>
They ask how it's going.<br>
It's a gentle way to come near: Words<br>
which remove the bandage without the wound beginning to bleed.<br>
A shy<br>
finger over the cheek.<br>
<br>
I could have answered with long explanations,<br>
told of holes in that veil we call Life,<br>
of the view through them: Sudden<br>
glimpses of snow-decked riddle-massifs, clearer<br>
than a single mathematical formula<br>
after a thousand calculations.<br>
<br>
Could also have told<br>
of days on the quay edge.<br>
Of the balancing act there.<br>
Of the yellow sunshine's deep which winds<br>
and never speaks in riddles, but solves them.<br>
<br>
Could have told everything, but answer:<br>
Just fine.<br>
Each in their way,<br>
everybody knows everything.

Original

<h3>
Alt
</h3>

<p>
De spør hvordan det går.<br>
Det er en skånsom måte å nærme seg på: Ord<br>
som fjerner bandasjen uten at såret begynner å blø.<br>
En sky<br>
finger over kinnet.<br>
<br>
Jeg kunne ha svart med lange forklaringer,<br>
fortalt om hullene i det sløret vi kaller Liv,<br>
om utsikten gjennom dem: Plutselige<br>
blikk mot snødekte gåtemassiv, klarere<br>
enn en eneste matematisk formel<br>
etter tusen utregninger.<br>
<br>
Kunne også ha fortalt<br>
om dagene på kaikanten.<br>
Om balansegangen der.<br>
Om det gule solskinnsdypet som snor seg<br>
og aldri snakker i gåter, men løser dem.<br>
<br>
Kunne ha fortalt alt, men svarer:<br>
Bare bra.<br>
Hver på sitt vis<br>
vet alle alt.

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
The phrase "hvordan det går", which I've translated to "how it's going", is related to a standard greeting in Norwegian ("Hvordan går det?") in the same way as in English ("How's it going?").
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The phrase "å nærme seg" could be translated as "to approach", but I feel that "to come near" slightly more closely captures the feeling of the original.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The phrase "Plutselige blikk mot" could more literally be translated as "Sudden glances towards", but "Sudden glimpses of" seems to better capture the feel of the original.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I have chosen to translate "snødekte gåtemassiv" very literally to "snow-decked riddle-massifs": the compound noun "gåtemassiv" is Falkeid's own construction, and I feel it best to allow it to stand as-is in English rather than attempt a circumlocution such as "mountains of riddles".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The imagery of the second verse is complex and double-edged, and I feel it even more important than usual that the translation keep very close to the original here, to allow the reader to ponder that imagery as Falkeid originally set it forth.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Similarly, I have chosen to translate "det gule solskinnsdypet" very literally to "the yellow sunshine's deep"; again, this is Falkeid's own, evocative, compound noun construction, and I feel the original poem is best served by rendering it as-is.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The phrase "snor seg" is a bit tricky to translate, but I feel that "winds" is much closer to the original in feel than, say, "twists". Even though use of "winds" in this way without further qualification is unusual in English, this is somewhat true of "snor seg" in Norwegian too,
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The repetition of "riddle(s)" in the third verse from the second verse is present in the original ("gåte"), and is important structurally to preserve, I feel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The phrase "Bare bra" (literally "Only well"), which I've translated as "Just fine", is a standard response to "Hvordan går det?" ("How's it going?") in Norwegian; it can be used formulaically, in much the same way as in English. The phrase "Fine thanks" would probably capture this even better in modern English, but I have chosen "Just fine" because it is closer to the original syntactically and in its literal meaning, whilst still I think having enough of the sense of being a standard/formulaic response for this to be able to be picked up by the reader.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When I first read this poem (it was the first of Falkeid's which I read closely, and it is one of my favourites), it took me about six readings of the poem or more before I could understand the concise eloquence of the final two lines! Thus, if the last two lines of the translation are not too easy to parse, this is a deliberate reflection of the original, which I have stayed very close to syntactically!
