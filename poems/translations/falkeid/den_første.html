<h3>
The first
</h3>

<p>
Eva dead. The first<br>
finely sown-together<br>
old friendship of the lot.<br>
The quietest. A life on the little wick<br>
shining with clear flame<br>
but which without flickering<br>
blew out.<br>
<br>
The teeming<br>
flower-languages' linguist.<br>
Heather-reader.<br>
<br>
Even in the sober Latin<br>
lush flora thrived. You coaxed<br>
brave wildflowers out upon the barren<br>
moors in us, tore up
bunches of colours from scorched thoughts.<br>
<br>
The rest of us<br>
keep going still. But perhaps<br>
the flowers close up<br>
in the middle of the day now?<br>
<br>
The worst thing<br>
is not to be the next to follow in your footsteps<br>
nor the one after that<br>
but the last.<br>
<br>
And to have to talk to oneself<br>
in a snowed-under<br>
winter tongue.

<h3>
Den første
</h3>

<p>
Eva død. Den første<br>
i flokken av fint sammensydd<br>
gammelt vennskap.<br>
Den stilleste. Et liv på den vesle veken<br>
lysende med klar flamme<br>
men som uten å blafre<br>
blåste vekk.<br>
<br>
De myldrende<br>
blomsterspråkenes lingvist.<br>
Lyngleseren.<br>
<br>
Selv i den sobre latinen<br>
trivdes frodig flora. Du lukket<br>
modige villblomster ut på de skrinne<br>
moene i oss, røsket<br>
kvaster av farger fra avsvidde tanker.<br>
<br>
Vi andre<br>
holder det ennå gående. Men kanskje<br>
lukker blomstene seg<br>
midt på dagen nå?<br>
<br>
Det verste<br>
er ikke å være nestemann ut på reisen din,<br>
heller ikke den andre<br>
men den siste.<br>
<br>
Og måtte snakke med seg selv<br>
på et nedsnødd<br>
vinterspråk.

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The second sentence of the poem is tricky to translate: on the one hand, "fint sammensydd gammelt vennskap" ("finely sown-together old friendship") is in the singular, whilst on the other "Den første i flokken (av)" is a set phrase which literally means something along the lines of "The first of the crowd (of)", so that it would naturally combine in English with a plural.</p>
<p>To address this, I have made a rare choice to alter the word order somewhat, rendering the set phrase as "first of the lot", which I feel fits well with the tone of the poem as a whole, but splitting it up around "finely ... friendship". </p></li>
<li><p>Though the rendering of the preposition "på" to "on" in the phrase "på den vesle veken" leads to a rather unusual line in English ("on the little wick"), I like the feel of it.</p>
<p>
The adjective "vesle" might often be translated to "tiny", but I feel that "little" works best poetically here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, "vekk" would be translated to "away", so that "blåste vekk" would become "blew away". Whilst this is not impossible here, I feel that the more forceful "blew out" is much the better choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poem makes significant use of compound nouns, mostly of Falkeid's own construction, i.e. specific to the poem. I have rendered nearly all of these quite literally with a hyphen, as I feel this best allows the imagery to come through in a way faithful to the original: "sammensydd" becomes "sown-together", "blomsterspråkene" becomes "flower-languages'" (with a careful use of the plural possessive), "lyngleseren" becomes "heather-reader", and so on.</p>
<p>The final word ("vinterspråk") of the poem is an exception. A more literal translation would be to "winter-language", but I prefer "tongue" to "language" here, it being, I feel, slightly more flexible metaphorically, allowing in particular a combination with "winter" without a hyphen, leading to a richer, and more in natural in English, construction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The definite noun form in Norwegian is more flexible than in English, and often is best translated to the indefinite in poetry. Nevertheless, I feel that "den sobre latinen" almost certainly refers back to the previous stanza, or at least that the possibility of reading the line in this way is important, and, thus, though it is rather unusual, I feel that poem flows best with a literal translation to "the sober Latin". An indefinite rendering simply to "sober Latin", or a more strongly emphasised "that sober Latin", would both be possible, but "the sober Latin" seems to me to balance the imagery best.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The verb "røske" can be used in the expression "røske med ruta", the equivalent to which in English would be "tear up by the roots", the imagery of which is close to that of the poem. Thus I have chosen to translate "røsket" to "tore up"; the "up" could be omitted, but including it leads to a closer rhythm to the original, and anchors the translation more tightly, I feel, to the intended imagery.</p>
<p>
Though it has several meanings, the noun "kvast" can be used in the context of flowers, herbs, and similar, exactly as "bunch" can in English, and "bunches" thus seems the best translation of "kvaster" here.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whilst "Vi andre" would literally translate to "We others", I feel that the more flowing "The rest of us" fits better here. The remaining part of the sentence, "holder det ennå gående", too can be translated in several, slightly different ways, for example to "are still keeping going", but I have chosen the economical "keep going still" because I feel it works best rhythmically and tonally.</p>
<p>A point of note is that "gående" is a kind of gerund form in Norwegian (possibly the only way to form it), the use of which is sparing; it hence feels important to translate it to the gerund "going" in English.</p></li>
<li><p>The interrogative formulation of "Men kanskje blomstene... nå?" is a little unusual, but is equally so in the original. That is to say, the phrasing was a deliberate choice of Falkeid's.</p>
<p>One could translate "lukker blomstene seg" to "the flowers close themselves up", but I feel that omission of "themselves" does not significantly affect the meaning or mood of the line, whilst the greater pithiness of the resulting line fits well with the overall tone of the poem.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The line "Det verste" is an example of a construction in Norwegian in which a noun form can be omitted and left implicit: literally, it would translate to just "The worst". The translation I have, namely "The worst thing", seems to me to be closest equivalent in English, with a similar degree of genericity.</p>
<p>A couple of lines later, "den andre" is another occurrence of this. Literally, it can be translated to just "the second", but this is not really possible in English in combination with a translation of "nestemann" to "next"; though more verbose, "the one after that" seems to work well rhythmically as well as semantically.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>The phrase "nestemann ut på reisen din" is somewhat tricky to translate. Very literally, it could be rendered "the next man out on your journey". However, "nestemann" (literally "next man") is almost always used more loosely to mean something like "the next (person/one) along/in line", or "the person/one afterwards"; I have chosen to translate it simply to "next", as I feels that this combines best rhythmically with my rendering of "ut på reisen din" to "to follow in your footsteps".</p>
<p>The latter is a very loose translation, but I feel that, in being a set phrase, it has a down-to-earth quality that is present in the original, which more literal translations lack; as well as flowing well off the tongue, as the original does.</p>
</li>
<li>Literally, the compound noun "nedsnødd" would translate to "down-snowed", but "snowed-under" is the phrase typically used in English to express the same, and I have chosen it for its greater naturality. </li>
