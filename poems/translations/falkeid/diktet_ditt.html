Your poem
</h3>

<p>
has hidden itself on the back side of the moon.<br>
And the moon, you know,<br>
has 'captured rotation'.<br>
Doesn't turn its back to you.<br>
<br>
A fine fellow like that.

Diktet ditt
</h3>

<p>
har gjemt seg på baksida av månen.<br>
Og månen, vet du,<br>
har bunden rotasjon.<br>
Snur ikke ryggen til noen.<br>
<br>
Kjekk kar sånn.

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The standard translation of "baksida av månen" would be the "the far side of the moon", but "back side" is obviously essential here.</p></li>
<li>
<p>There are a few possible ways to refer to the concept of "bunden rotasjon" in English, for instance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidal locking</a>, but "captured rotation" is closest to the Norwegian term; indeed the latter was originally probably translated from this English term.
</p>
<p>
I feel that adding inverted commas around "captured rotation" in the translation helps make clear that this is a reference to a certain concept.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is fortunate that "turning one's back to someone" has the same double meaning in English as  "snur ryggen til noen" has in Norwegian!</p>
<p>How to translate "noen" here depends somewhat on how one reads the line. If one heavily emphasises "noen", one must really translate to "anyone" or "anybody". If however one reads "ryggen til noen" with most emphasis on (the first syllable of) "ryggen", I feel that "you" captures the sense well, and the resulting more concise line has a better rhythmic feel, it seems to me, that with "anyone" or "anybody". For that reason, I have chosen to translate to "you".
</p></li>
<li><p>How to translate the final "sånn", vital to the wit of the poem, is the trickiest point, as single words such as "thus", which sometimes can be used for "sånn", do not work here. "In that way" is one possibility, but I have chosen "like that" for its greater abruptness/concision, bringing it closer to the pithiness of the original.</p>
<p>
Though there is no article in the original Norwegian, and it is entirely possible not to use one in the English rendering either, I feel that the weight of the translated final line is better if one includes an indefinite article at the beginning of it.
