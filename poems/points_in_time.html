Snow fell,<br>
bare branches received it;<br>

froze, dwelt,<br>
and naught there demeaned it.

A newborn light<br>
the lake throughout<br>
dissolves its ice;<br>
and lilts the lanes,<br>
where earth again<br>
emerges ploughed.

Inspired by, and composed in sketch form during, a walk by Jonsvatnet
as far as Nedre Jervan on the 14th of January 2024, and a walk along
Engels√•sveien in early spring the previous year. Mostly brought into shape on
the 15th of January, and completed on the evening of the 17th.
