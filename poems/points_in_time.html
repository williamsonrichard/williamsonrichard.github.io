Snow fell,<br>
bare branches received it;<br>

Froze, dwelt,<br>
where nought else demeaned it.

A newborn light<br>
a lake throughout<br>
dissolves its ice;<br>
and lilts the lanes,<br>
where earth again<br>
emerges ploughed.

Inspired by, and composed in sketch form during, a walk by Jonsvatnet
as far as Nedre Jervan on the 14th of January 2024, and a walk along
Engelsåsveien in early spring the previous year. Mostly brought into shape on
the 15th of January, and completed on the evening of the 17th. Slight tweaks
in August 2025, and again in November 2025.
