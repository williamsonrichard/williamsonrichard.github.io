Etched upon the water, four straight lines:<br>
pegmatite veins within rock.<br>
Wind-without at morning, five hours' time:<br>

Written on the morning of the 26th of July 2023, looking out over the same bay at Flakstad in Lofoten as when I wrote <a href="disturbance.html">Disturbance</a>. Inspired by waves observed there the previous night, as well as the landscape of Leka.
