Written on the 5th of February 2026, with the idea coming to me on the 4th during a run, upon hearing woodpeckers knock for the first time in the year in two places along Engelsåsveien and Jonsvannsveien, despite temperatures considerably below zero, and no further precipitation, having kept snow that fell between Christmas and New Year frozen in place throughout January.
