Disturbance

<p>
Geese took off from the lee<br>
for quiet, and open sea —<br>
to retreat there a while,<br>
'til my footsteps ceased,<br>
then glide unlooked to their isle.

Written on the morning of the 25th of July 2023, looking out over a bay at Flakstad in Lofoten.
</p>
<p>
Inspired principally by my disturbing of a flock of geese whilst crossing a low stone bridge to Madsøya in Leka municipality on the evening of the 15th of July, when the idea of the poem first came to me; reinforced by a second disturbing of a flock at Skjelfjord, Lofoten on the 24th!
