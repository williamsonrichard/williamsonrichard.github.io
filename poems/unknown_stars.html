If we saw as far<br>
As the farthest star<br>
Would this part of night<br>
To our sight be dark<br>
Or entirely white?</p>

Composed on the 3rd of November, 2024.

Inspired by an unusually clear night for the stars when walking along Engels√•sveien some days before, glimpsing distant stars filling the dark between the constellations; and by a magnificent night sky a decade and a half earlier on Anglesey.
