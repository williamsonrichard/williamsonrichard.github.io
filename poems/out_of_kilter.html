Out of kilter

<p>
Jupiter's displaced the moon<br>
and leftmost one star of Orion's belt<br>
ruddies brighter than the other two.<br>
<br>
Streetlight-less once passed the bridge,<br>
this twenty-third hour of a working day<br>
thickens sour as with the dark of six.<br>
<br>
Miles through pipes away and out,<br>
an opening tap fills a night-owl's glass<br>
metres down from where the road here prowls.

Inspired by a walk along Engels√•sveien on the evening of the 29th of September 2022; fragments of it were also composed during this walk. The poem as a whole was composed between the 29th of September and the 7th of October. I removed a stanza in December 2022.

<p>
I recorded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2HkmJKnRypQ">reading</a> of the poem in October 2022. It includes the now removed stanza.
