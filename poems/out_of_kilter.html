<h1>
Out of kilter
</h1>

<div class="line">

<p>
Jupiter's displaced the moon<br>
and, leftmost, one star of Orion's belt<br>
ruddies brighter than the other two.<br>
<br>
Streetlight-less once passed the bridge,<br>
this twenty-third hour of a working day<br>
thickens sour as with the dark of six.<br>
<br>
Miles through pipes away and out,<br>
an opening tap fills a night-owl's glass<br>
metres down from where the road here prowls.<br>
<br>
Windlessly the water broods,<br>
and shadows lurk hidden amongst the trees,<br>
poised to surge if the moon be unleashed.

Inspired by a walk along Engels√•sveien on the evening of the 29th of September 2022; fragments of it were also composed during this walk. The poem as a whole was composed between the 29th of September and the 7th of October.
