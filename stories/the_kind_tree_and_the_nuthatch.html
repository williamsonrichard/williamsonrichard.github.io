The kind tree and the nuthatch
</h1>

<div class="line">

<p>
There was once a tree which a nuthatch knew truly to be kind. When the
wind blew scathingly, and the tree felt the nuthatch, stepping upon its bark, become uncertain, it would give up its nearby
branches to the storm. When the wind only ruffled gently, the nuthatch
taught the tree the joy of a cold stream against the feet.
</p>

<p>
The tree's heart and mind were a conjunction of
its roots and the living earth in which they wound. But it
could feel each knot of bark on which the nuthatch landed;
could guide it by the refraction of light in its resin.
</p>

<p>
Yet the nuthatch did not belong this far north, and the time came for it
to return.
</p>

<p>
Though to some the tree was aloof, four deer then came to it when tiny. With the slow vigour of its sap veins, with the time-wisened
strength of the rings of its inner wood, the tree would
teach them its kindness: feed them from its bark in the winter; from
its buds in the spring and early summer; from blueberries and
foxberries — nestling thickly underneath the high branches on one sunny
side of it — in the late summer and autumn.
</p>

<p>
But the tree knew a sadness — had always known it. Lightened by
the calm coming and going of its leaves; by longed-for morning warmth, amongst moist moss, in
early spring; by the first
footprints of its deer-children upon fresh, coruscating snow; but irremovable.
</p>

<p>
Much time passed. The nuthatch would send word to the tree, and the
tree, proud to hear of it carrying out
its work in its thickets, would send word to the nuthatch.
</p>

<p>
One day the tree sensed anew the touch of the nuthatch's little wing
on its bark. The nuthatch told, long into the night, of open sea, of
lighthouses on skerries, of low hills of rock and grass tumbling up
from the shore, of plains like those of a Western, of forest — now like that of which the tree was part,
now otherwise. The tree felt what the nuthatch — cheerily, deftly hopping from trunk to branch to trunk in its furrows — had felt and now felt; and what they felt would endure, reverberating in leaf and wing.
