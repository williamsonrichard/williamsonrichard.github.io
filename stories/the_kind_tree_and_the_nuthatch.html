<h1>
The kind tree and the nuthatch
</h1>

<div class="line">

<p>
There was once a tree which a nuthatch truly knew to be kind. When the
wind blew scathingly and the tree felt the nuthatch to be uncertain in
its step on the bark of its trunk, it would give up his nearby
branches to the storm, to be wrenched into a safehaven of foliage.
When the wind only ruffled gently, the nuthatch taught it the joy of a
cold stream tickling the feet; delighted the tree in its ways.
</p>

<p>
The tree's heart and mind were under the forest moss, a conjunction of
its bristling roots and the living earth in which they wound. But it
could feel the smallest knot of bark on which the nuthatch landed;
could guide it with a drop of golden resin to refract the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
The nuthatch did not belong this far north, and the time came for it
to return. Four deer came to the tree when tiny, though to some it was
aloof. In the slow vigour of its resin veins, in the strength of its
inner wood being pressed into rings, the tree would teach them its
kindness; feed them from its bark in the winter, from its buds in the
spring and early summer, from the blueberries and foxberries nestling
thickly underneath the high branches on one sunny side of it in the
late summer and autumn.
</p>

<p>
But the tree knew a deep sadness â€” had always known it. Lightened by
the calm coming and the going of its leaves, by transcendent days of
early spring moss in longed-for warmth of a morning, by the first
footprints of its deer-children in corruscating snow, but irremovable.
</p>

<p>
Much time passed. The nuthatch would send word to the tree, and the
tree would send word to the nuthatch; it was proud to hear of the
nutcatch quietly carrying out its work in the thickets of its home.
</p>

<p>
Yet one day the tree felt anew the touch of the nuthatch's little wing
on its bark. The nuthatch told, long into the night, of open sea, of
lighthouses on skerries, of low hills of rock and grass tumbling up
from the shore, of forest, here like that of which the tree was part,
there like the plains of a Western; the tree felt what the nuthatch
had felt, and the nuthatch, hopping from trunk to branch to trunk,
learnt in the lines of the wood, silently, of the deeds of the tree's
kindness in the time that had passed.
</p>

<p>
It was a visit of a day. Much time would likely pass once more, but
the nuthatch would come again; the tree's sadness would again be
crashed away like the open sea against the skerries of which the
nuthatch told with the rare happiness of being truly understood. This
was enough.
