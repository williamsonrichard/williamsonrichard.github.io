<h1>
The kind tree and the nuthatch
</h1>

<div class="line">

<p>
There was once a tree which a nuthatch knew truly to be kind. When the
wind blew scathingly and the tree felt the nuthatch to be uncertain in
its step on the bark of its trunk, it would give up its nearby
branches to the storm. When the wind only ruffled gently, the nuthatch
taught it the joy of a cold stream against the feet.
</p>

<p>
The tree's heart and mind were under the forest moss, a conjunction of
its bristling roots and the living earth in which they wound. But it
could feel each knot of bark on which the nuthatch landed;
could guide it with a drop of golden resin to refract the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
Yet the nuthatch did not belong this far north, and the time came for it
to return.
</p>

<p>
Four deer then came to the tree when tiny, though to some it was
aloof. With the slow vigour of its resin veins, with the time-wisened
strength of its inner wood being pressed into rings, the tree would
teach them its kindness; feed them from its bark in the winter, from
its buds in the spring and early summer, from blueberries and
foxberries, nestling thickly underneath the high branches on one sunny
side of it, in the late summer and autumn.
</p>

<p>
But the tree knew a sadness — had always known it. Lightened by
the calm coming and going of its leaves, by transcendent days of
early spring moss in longed-for morning warmth, by the first
footprints of its deer-children in corruscating snow, but irremovable.
</p>

<p>
Much time passed. The nuthatch would send word to the tree, and the
tree would send word to the nuthatch; it was proud to hear of the
nutcatch carrying out its work in the thickets of its home.
</p>

<p>
One day the tree felt anew the touch of the nuthatch's little wing
on its bark. The nuthatch told, long into the night, of open sea, of
lighthouses on skerries, of low hills of rock and grass tumbling up
from the shore, of forest — here like that of which the tree was part,
there like the plains of a Western. The tree felt what the nuthatch
had felt, and the nuthatch, hopping from trunk to branch to trunk,
learnt in the lines of the wood of the deeds of the tree in the time
that had passed.
</p>

<p>
Crashing away the tree's sadness, it was the visit of a day. Much
time apart would likely pass once more — but this would be sustenance
enough.
