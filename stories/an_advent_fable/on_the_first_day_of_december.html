On the first day of December

<p>
It was the last of twilight. Far to the west, a corner of the sky was orange and teal of an ancient, contemplative hue. Otherwise night had fallen, cold and clear. Stars and frost had begun to dust the darkness.
</p>

<p>
A little bearded fellow — an elf, in the tongue of some — was walking around a thinly iced-over lake with a lantern. Frozen grass, reeds, and twigs crackled under his boots. Suddenly he stopped.
</p>

<p>
In the corner of his eye, under the surface: was that a momentary, darting line of light? He held out his lantern over the lake, bringing it to crystalline illumination. "A reflection," he concluded.
</p>

<p>
Resuming walking, he held the lantern on the other side of himself from the lake. And reeled again to a stop.
</p>

<p>
An evanescent streak of light under the ice, that time, surely? He peered out, straining his eyes against the night. Nothing.
</p>

<p>
And yet... there! Further out this time. Like a shooting star.
</p>

<p>
Nothing. Nothing... Again! And again! Dazzling, arrowing light, bursting ephemerally up under the ice as though trying to break through it. Now here... now there!
</p>

<p>
The little bearded fellow stood there a long while; then hurried home. Stoking up the fireplace to a blaze, he sat with toast and butter before it, warming his cheeks in its glow, pondering.
