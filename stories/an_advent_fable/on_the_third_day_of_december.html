<h1>
On the third day of December

<p>
At the onset of dusk, the little bearded fellow scurried off upon an errand, passing as he did a fine, high pine<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup> tree, a little set apart within the forest. A light wind blew. In an annulus, around the base of its trunk, lay a broad mesh of frosted needles and cones.
</p>

<p>
A tiny treecreeper, on the other side of the trunk from the path the little bearded fellow took, was investigating a furrow in the bark. Pecking...
</p>

<p>
Ruminating, with head askew, upon the best angle for a thin, curved, beak to ascertain whether there lay something in a little hole there...
</p>

<p>
Pecking...
</p>

<p>
Proceeding helically a few steps up the trunk...
</p>

<p>
Pecking...
</p>

<p>
The treecreeper stopped. Fluttered a few startled inches away from the trunk; and floated back — through a little crevice it saw a pool of light. Like liquid sap, with a mystical hue. A mellifluous infusion of not-quite-orange in transparency.
</p>

<p>
Bewildered, the treecreeper flew from the furrow to the dense foliage at the top of the tree. What was it, that light?
</p>

<p>
It resolved, after a time, to try another spot. Finding a likely cleft a little further down the trunk than before, it once more began to nick away at a hole. Dark fell, but the treecreeper continued —
</p>

<p>
It was through... Again, the peculiar light was there!
</p>

<p>
The treecreeper peered a little longer this time. Was it just its own breath — warmed by its work — upon the cold air of the night, or did the light seem to emanate fine threads of steam?
</p>

<p>
Was it just angles of moonlight through the forest upon it, shifting at the caprice of the breeze, or did the light seem to simmer?
</p>

<p>
The treecreeper took off for its nest and repose. It would dream, deeply and expansively — novel, strange dreams.
