Dusk again found the little bearded fellow upon an errand. At quite a clip, he walked a full Norwegian mile<sup><a href="#footnote_1">1</a></sup> through the forest, on old pathways, before halting at a house.

<p>
He was — in his preferred designation — a clock-tenderer, and it was indeed the house's clock to which his errand pertained.
