<h1>
Transcendental moments — A deer in the grass and the mist
</h1>

<div class="line">

<p>
Not quite dusk. Walking along Engelsåsveien, down the steep hill with Nyjordveien at its foot. A slight autumnal crispness to the air. Exceptionally quiet and still.
</p>

<p>
In a small meadow to the left, a low mist resting ethereally amongst the grass and just above it.
</p>

<p>
Having walked past, I turn back for a last glimpse...
</p>

<p>
A single, standing deer, three-quarters absorbed by the mist. Slowly, gracefully, it bends for a few strands of grass, becoming immersed.
</p>

<p>
I stand stock-still for an age. Purity.
