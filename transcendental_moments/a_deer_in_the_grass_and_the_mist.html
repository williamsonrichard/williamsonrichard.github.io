<h1>
Transcendental moments — A deer in the grass and the mist
</h1>

<div class="line">

<p>
Not quite dusk — just before. Walking along Engelsåsveien, on my way down the steep hill just before (in that direction) the start of Nyjordveien. A slight autumnal crispness to the air. Exceptionally, ethereally, quiet and still.
</p>

<p>
A beautiful low mist amongst the grass in a small meadow to my left, and resting just above it. Having walked past, I turn back for a last glimpse of the purity of the scene.
</p>

<p>
A single deer, three-quarters absorbed by the mist, gracefully standing, slowly bending for a few strands of grass and mist; gracefully standing, slowly bending, entirely unaware of my stock-still presence, immersed into deep tranquility.
