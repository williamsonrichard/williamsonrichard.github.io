<h1>
Transcendental moments — A deer in the grass and the mist
</h1>

<div class="line">

<p>
Not quite dusk. I walking along Engelsåsveien, down the steep hill with Nyjordveien at its foot. Slight autumnal crispness to the air. Exceptionally quiet and still.
</p>

<p>
In a small meadow to my left, a beautiful low mist amongst the grass. Resting ethereally just above it.
</p>

<p>
 Having walked past, I turn back for a last glimpse.
</p>

<p>
A single, standing deer, three-quarters absorbed by the mist. Slowly, gracefully it bends for a few strands of grass. Immersed. I stock-still.
</p>

<p>
Deep tranquility. Purity.
