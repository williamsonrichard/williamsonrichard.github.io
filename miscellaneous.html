I am currently helping out with development and maintenance of the software behind the <a href="https://ncatlab.org">nLab</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have posted some recordings (simply done, on a mobile phone!) of myself accompanied by a guitar. Mostly old folk or roots songs, but occasionally dipping into other things. The full list can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWxDqgSTmXGLOxKP0vSllbA/videos">here</a>. Some that I feel particularly happy with (even if they are far from perfect) are the following: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGVyLuDmsbw">Fly</a> (Nick Drake), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwN9v-6-bp0">Hughie the Graeme</a> (ancient Scottish ballad), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxSGIMVNkH4">La marche nuptiale</a> (by George Brassens), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9hbUxDX24c">Fola, fola blakken</a> (Norwegian children's song), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exReya3G11U">Changing of the guards</a> (Bob Dylan), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qByyYfWKMyo">The Cannonball</a> (roots song, Carter family).
</p>

I have written down a couple of stories, originally intended to be children's stories, but perhaps not quite ending up as such: <a href="stories/the_giant,the_little_girl,and_the_butterfly.html">The giant, the little girl, and the butterfly</a>, and <a href="stories/the_forest_clock.html">The forest clock</a>.
